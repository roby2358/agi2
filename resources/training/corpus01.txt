### 1. PROPOSITIONAL LOGIC FUNDAMENTALS

#### Basic Propositions and Truth Values

Propositional logic is the foundation of mathematical reasoning, dealing with statements that can be either true or false. These statements, called propositions, form the building blocks of logical arguments.

**What is a Proposition?**

A proposition is a declarative statement that has exactly one truth value: either true (T) or false (F). Unlike questions, commands, or exclamations, propositions make claims about the world that can be evaluated.

**Examples of Propositions:**
- "The sky is blue" (true in most circumstances)
- "2 + 2 = 4" (always true)
- "Paris is the capital of France" (true)
- "The moon is made of cheese" (false)
- "x + 1 = 5" (not a proposition - depends on x)

**Non-Propositions:**
- "What time is it?" (question)
- "Close the door!" (command)
- "Wow!" (exclamation)
- "This statement is false" (paradox - not a valid proposition)

#### Logical Connectives

Logical connectives are operators that combine propositions to form more complex statements. The five fundamental connectives are:

**1. Negation (NOT) - ¬**
- Symbol: ¬p or ~p
- Meaning: "not p" or "it is not the case that p"
- Truth table: If p is true, ¬p is false; if p is false, ¬p is true

**2. Conjunction (AND) - ∧**
- Symbol: p ∧ q
- Meaning: "p and q" - both p and q must be true
- Truth table: p ∧ q is true only when both p and q are true

**3. Disjunction (OR) - ∨**
- Symbol: p ∨ q
- Meaning: "p or q" - at least one of p or q must be true (inclusive OR)
- Truth table: p ∨ q is false only when both p and q are false

**4. Implication (IF-THEN) - →**
- Symbol: p → q
- Meaning: "if p then q" or "p implies q"
- Truth table: p → q is false only when p is true and q is false

**5. Biconditional (IF-AND-ONLY-IF) - ↔**
- Symbol: p ↔ q
- Meaning: "p if and only if q" - p and q have the same truth value
- Truth table: p ↔ q is true when both p and q are true, or both are false

#### Truth Tables and Logical Equivalencies

Truth tables systematically display all possible truth value combinations for logical expressions. They provide a mechanical method for determining when complex statements are true or false.

**Basic Truth Table Structure:**
For n variables, a truth table has 2^n rows covering every possible combination.

**Example: Truth Table for p ∧ q**
```
p | q | p ∧ q
--|---|-------
T | T |   T
T | F |   F
F | T |   F
F | F |   F
```

**Example: Truth Table for p → q**
```
p | q | p → q
--|---|-------
T | T |   T
T | F |   F
F | T |   T
F | F |   T
```

**Key Insight:** The implication p → q is only false when p is true and q is false. When p is false, the implication is considered true regardless of q's value. This might seem counterintuitive, but it's the standard definition in logic.

#### Logical Equivalencies

Two logical expressions are equivalent if they have identical truth tables. Some important equivalencies include:

**De Morgan's Laws:**
- ¬(p ∧ q) ≡ ¬p ∨ ¬q
- ¬(p ∨ q) ≡ ¬p ∧ ¬q

**Implication Equivalencies:**
- p → q ≡ ¬p ∨ q
- p → q ≡ ¬q → ¬p (contrapositive)

**Double Negation:**
- ¬(¬p) ≡ p

**Distributive Laws:**
- p ∧ (q ∨ r) ≡ (p ∧ q) ∨ (p ∧ r)
- p ∨ (q ∧ r) ≡ (p ∨ q) ∧ (p ∨ r)

#### Tautologies, Contradictions, and Contingencies

**Tautologies** are logical expressions that are always true, regardless of the truth values of their variables.

**Example:** p ∨ ¬p (the law of excluded middle)
```
p | ¬p | p ∨ ¬p
--|----|--------
T | F  |   T
F | T  |   T
```

**Contradictions** are logical expressions that are always false, regardless of the truth values of their variables.

**Example:** p ∧ ¬p (the law of non-contradiction)
```
p | ¬p | p ∧ ¬p
--|----|--------
T | F  |   F
F | T  |   F
```

**Contingencies** are logical expressions that can be either true or false depending on the truth values of their variables.

**Example:** p ∧ q
```
p | q | p ∧ q
--|---|-------
T | T |   T
T | F |   F
F | T |   F
F | F |   F
```

#### Logical Validity and Soundness

**Logical Validity** refers to the structure of an argument, not its content. An argument is valid if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.

**Example of a Valid Argument:**
- Premise 1: If it's raining, then the ground is wet
- Premise 2: It's raining
- Conclusion: Therefore, the ground is wet

This argument is valid because the conclusion follows logically from the premises, even if the premises are factually incorrect.

**Example of an Invalid Argument:**
- Premise 1: If it's raining, then the ground is wet
- Premise 2: The ground is wet
- Conclusion: Therefore, it's raining

This argument is invalid because the conclusion doesn't logically follow from the premises. The ground could be wet for other reasons (sprinklers, melting snow, etc.).

**Soundness** requires both validity and true premises. A sound argument has a valid structure and factually correct premises, guaranteeing a true conclusion.

**Real-World Application: Computer Programming**

Propositional logic is fundamental to computer programming. Boolean variables, conditional statements, and logical operators all rely on propositional logic:

```python
# Example: Logical operators in Python
is_sunny = True
is_warm = True

if is_sunny and is_warm:
    print("Great day for a picnic!")
elif is_sunny or is_warm:
    print("Not bad weather")
else:
    print("Stay inside")

# Logical equivalency: not (A and B) == (not A) or (not B)
if not (is_sunny and is_warm):
    print("Not perfect weather")
```

**Common Misconceptions**

1. **Implication Confusion:** Many people think "if p then q" means "p causes q," but logical implication is about truth values, not causation.

2. **OR vs XOR:** In logic, OR is inclusive (p ∨ q is true if both are true), but in everyday language, "or" is often exclusive.

3. **Negation Scope:** The negation of "p and q" is "not p or not q," not "not p and not q."

**Practice Problems**

1. **Truth Table Construction:** Create truth tables for:
   - (p ∧ q) → r
   - ¬(p ∨ q) ∧ (¬p ∨ ¬q)

2. **Logical Equivalency:** Prove that p → q is equivalent to ¬q → ¬p using truth tables.

3. **Argument Validity:** Determine if this argument is valid:
   - Premise: All students study hard
   - Premise: John is a student
   - Conclusion: Therefore, John studies hard

**Solutions:**

**Solution 1: Truth Table Construction**

**a) (p ∧ q) → r**
Truth table for 3 variables (p, q, r) requires 2³ = 8 rows:

| p | q | r | p∧q | (p∧q)→r |
|---|---|---|------|----------|
| T | T | T |  T   |    T     |
| T | T | F |  T   |    F     |
| T | F | T |  F   |    T     |
| T | F | F |  F   |    T     |
| F | T | T |  F   |    T     |
| F | T | F |  F   |    T     |
| F | F | T |  F   |    T     |
| F | F | F |  F   |    T     |

**b) ¬(p ∨ q) ∧ (¬p ∨ ¬q)**
First, let's break this down step by step:

| p | q | p∨q | ¬(p∨q) | ¬p | ¬q | ¬p∨¬q | ¬(p∨q)∧(¬p∨¬q) |
|---|---|------|---------|----|----|--------|------------------|
| T | T |  T   |    F    |  F |  F |   F    |        F         |
| T | F |  T   |    F    |  F |  T |   T    |        F         |
| F | T |  T   |    F    |  T |  F |   T    |        F         |
| F | F |  F   |    T    |  T |  T |   T    |        T         |

**Solution 2: Logical Equivalency Proof**

**Prove: p → q is equivalent to ¬q → ¬p**

We'll show this using truth tables:

| p | q | p→q | ¬q | ¬p | ¬q→¬p |
|---|---|------|----|----|--------|
| T | T |  T   |  F |  F |   T    |
| T | F |  F   |  T |  F |   F    |
| F | T |  T   |  F |  T |   T    |
| F | F |  T   |  T |  T |   T    |

Since the columns for p→q and ¬q→¬p are identical, they are logically equivalent.

**Solution 3: Argument Validity**

**Premise 1:** All students study hard
**Premise 2:** John is a student  
**Conclusion:** Therefore, John studies hard

**Analysis:**
This is a valid argument using universal instantiation:
- Premise 1: ∀x (Student(x) → StudiesHard(x))
- Premise 2: Student(John)
- Conclusion: StudiesHard(John)

**Validity Check:**
If we assume both premises are true:
- Premise 1 means "For every person x, if x is a student, then x studies hard"
- Premise 2 means "John is a student"
- By universal instantiation, we can substitute John for x in Premise 1
- This gives us: Student(John) → StudiesHard(John)
- Since Student(John) is true (Premise 2), and the implication is true, we must have StudiesHard(John) = true

**Therefore:** The argument is valid. If the premises are true, the conclusion must be true.

**Historical Context**

Propositional logic has ancient roots, with Aristotle developing syllogistic logic around 350 BCE. However, the modern symbolic approach emerged in the 19th century with the work of George Boole, who created Boolean algebra. This mathematical foundation enabled the development of digital computers and modern computer science.

**Advanced Extensions**

While basic propositional logic deals with simple true/false statements, more advanced systems include:
- Modal logic (dealing with possibility and necessity)
- Temporal logic (dealing with time and change)
- Fuzzy logic (dealing with degrees of truth)
- Intuitionistic logic (rejecting the law of excluded middle)

### 2. PREDICATE LOGIC & QUANTIFICATION

#### Predicates and Variables

While propositional logic deals with complete statements, predicate logic allows us to analyze the internal structure of statements by breaking them down into predicates and variables. This enables more sophisticated logical reasoning about relationships, properties, and quantities.

**What is a Predicate?**

A predicate is a function that takes one or more variables and returns a truth value. Think of it as a template that becomes a proposition when specific values are substituted for the variables.

**Examples of Predicates:**
- P(x): "x is a student"
- Q(x, y): "x loves y"
- R(x, y, z): "x is between y and z"
- S(x): "x is prime"

**From Predicates to Propositions:**
- P(Alice) = "Alice is a student" (a proposition)
- Q(John, Mary) = "John loves Mary" (a proposition)
- R(5, 3, 7) = "5 is between 3 and 7" (a proposition)

**Variables and Domains:**
Variables in predicates range over specific domains (sets of objects). For example:
- x ∈ People (x ranges over all people)
- y ∈ Numbers (y ranges over all numbers)
- z ∈ Cities (z ranges over all cities)

#### Universal and Existential Quantifiers

Quantifiers specify how many objects in a domain satisfy a predicate. The two fundamental quantifiers are:

**Universal Quantifier (∀) - "For all"**
- Symbol: ∀x P(x)
- Meaning: "For all x, P(x) is true" or "Every x satisfies P(x)"
- Examples:
  - ∀x (x is human → x is mortal): "All humans are mortal"
  - ∀x (x > 0 → x² > 0): "Every positive number has a positive square"

**Existential Quantifier (∃) - "There exists"**
- Symbol: ∃x P(x)
- Meaning: "There exists an x such that P(x) is true" or "At least one x satisfies P(x)"
- Examples:
  - ∃x (x is human ∧ x is immortal): "There exists an immortal human"
  - ∃x (x² = 4): "There exists a number whose square is 4"

**Mixed Quantifiers:**
When multiple quantifiers appear, the order matters significantly:

**Example 1:** ∀x ∃y (x < y)
- "For every number x, there exists a number y such that x < y"
- This is true (for any x, we can choose y = x + 1)

**Example 2:** ∃y ∀x (x < y)
- "There exists a number y such that for every number x, x < y"
- This is false (no single number is greater than all numbers)

**Key Insight:** The order of quantifiers affects meaning. ∀x ∃y means "for each x, we can find a y," while ∃y ∀x means "we can find one y that works for all x."

#### Logical Forms and Structure

Predicate logic provides a systematic way to represent the logical structure of statements in natural language.

**Standard Forms:**

**Universal Statements:**
- "All A are B" → ∀x (A(x) → B(x))
- "No A are B" → ∀x (A(x) → ¬B(x))
- "Every A has property P" → ∀x (A(x) → P(x))

**Existential Statements:**
- "Some A are B" → ∃x (A(x) ∧ B(x))
- "There exists an A with property P" → ∃x (A(x) ∧ P(x))
- "At least one A is B" → ∃x (A(x) ∧ B(x))

**Mixed Quantifier Statements:**
- "Everyone loves someone" → ∀x ∃y L(x, y)
- "Someone is loved by everyone" → ∃y ∀x L(x, y)
- "Everyone loves everyone" → ∀x ∀y L(x, y)

**Example: Translating Natural Language**

**Statement:** "Every student who studies hard passes the exam"

**Analysis:**
1. Identify the subject: students who study hard
2. Identify the predicate: pass the exam
3. Determine quantifier: every (universal)
4. Structure: ∀x (Student(x) ∧ StudiesHard(x) → PassesExam(x))

**Verification:**
- If x is a student who studies hard, then x passes the exam
- If x is not a student or doesn't study hard, the implication is true (antecedent false)
- This correctly captures the original meaning

#### Validity in Predicate Logic

Validity in predicate logic is more complex than in propositional logic because we must consider the structure of predicates and the relationships between quantifiers.

**Logical Equivalencies in Predicate Logic:**

**Quantifier Negation:**
- ¬∀x P(x) ≡ ∃x ¬P(x)
- ¬∃x P(x) ≡ ∀x ¬P(x)

**Distribution Laws:**
- ∀x (P(x) ∧ Q(x)) ≡ ∀x P(x) ∧ ∀x Q(x)
- ∃x (P(x) ∨ Q(x)) ≡ ∃x P(x) ∨ ∃x Q(x)

**Important Note:** Universal quantifiers don't distribute over disjunction, and existential quantifiers don't distribute over conjunction:
- ∀x (P(x) ∨ Q(x)) ≠ ∀x P(x) ∨ ∀x Q(x)
- ∃x (P(x) ∧ Q(x)) ≠ ∃x P(x) ∧ ∃x Q(x)

**Example: Invalid Distribution**
Consider the domain of all people:
- ∀x (x is tall ∨ x is short) means "Everyone is either tall or short"
- ∀x (x is tall) ∨ ∀x (x is short) means "Everyone is tall OR everyone is short"

These are clearly different statements!

**Validity Testing Methods:**

**1. Counterexample Method:**
To show an argument is invalid, find a domain and interpretation where premises are true but conclusion is false.

**2. Semantic Tableaux:**
Systematic method for testing validity by exploring all possible interpretations.

**3. Natural Deduction:**
Formal proof system with rules for introducing and eliminating quantifiers.

#### Relationship to Natural Language

Predicate logic provides a bridge between formal mathematical reasoning and everyday language, helping us identify logical structure and potential ambiguities.

**Common Translation Patterns:**

**"Only" Statements:**
- "Only A are B" → ∀x (B(x) → A(x))
- "A are the only B" → ∀x (B(x) ↔ A(x))

**"Most" and "Many":**
- These require more sophisticated logic (fuzzy logic or probability)
- "Most students study hard" cannot be directly translated to standard predicate logic

**"The" (Definite Descriptions):**
- "The king of France is bald" → ∃x (KingOfFrance(x) ∧ ∀y (KingOfFrance(y) → y = x) ∧ Bald(x))
- This shows why "the present king of France is bald" is problematic (no such king exists)

**Ambiguity Detection:**

**Example:** "Every student loves some teacher"

This could mean:
1. **∀x ∃y (Student(x) → (Teacher(y) ∧ Loves(x, y)))**
   - For each student, there is some teacher they love (possibly different teachers)

2. **∃y ∀x (Student(x) → (Teacher(y) ∧ Loves(x, y)))**
   - There is one teacher that every student loves

The original statement is ambiguous because it doesn't specify whether the same teacher is loved by all students.

**Real-World Application: Database Query Languages**

Predicate logic is fundamental to database systems and query languages like SQL:

```sql
-- Universal quantifier: All employees in department 10
SELECT * FROM employees 
WHERE dept_id = 10;

-- Existential quantifier: Employees who work on some project
SELECT DISTINCT e.* FROM employees e
JOIN assignments a ON e.emp_id = a.emp_id;

-- Mixed quantifiers: Departments where every employee earns over 50000
SELECT d.dept_name FROM departments d
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM employees e 
    WHERE e.dept_id = d.dept_id AND e.salary <= 50000
);
```

**Common Misconceptions**

1. **Quantifier Order:** Many people don't realize that ∀x ∃y and ∃y ∀x have different meanings.

2. **Scope of Variables:** Variables bound by quantifiers have limited scope, but this is often misunderstood.

3. **Empty Domains:** Statements like ∀x P(x) are considered true when the domain is empty, which can be counterintuitive.

**Practice Problems**

1. **Translation:** Translate to predicate logic:
   - "Some students like all subjects"
   - "No student likes every subject"
   - "Every student who likes math likes physics"

2. **Negation:** Find the negation of ∀x ∃y (P(x) → Q(x, y))

3. **Validity:** Determine if this argument is valid:
   - Premise: ∀x (Student(x) → Studies(x))
   - Premise: ∃x (Student(x) ∧ Smart(x))
   - Conclusion: ∃x (Studies(x) ∧ Smart(x))

**Solutions:**

**Solution 1: Translation to Predicate Logic**

**a) "Some students like all subjects"**
- Let S(x) = "x is a student"
- Let L(x,y) = "x likes y"
- Let Subj(y) = "y is a subject"
- Translation: ∃x (S(x) ∧ ∀y (Subj(y) → L(x,y)))

**b) "No student likes every subject"**
- Translation: ¬∃x (S(x) ∧ ∀y (Subj(y) → L(x,y)))
- Or equivalently: ∀x (S(x) → ¬∀y (Subj(y) → L(x,y)))
- Or: ∀x (S(x) → ∃y (Subj(y) ∧ ¬L(x,y)))

**c) "Every student who likes math likes physics"**
- Let M(x) = "x likes math"
- Let P(x) = "x likes physics"
- Translation: ∀x ((S(x) ∧ M(x)) → P(x))

**Solution 2: Negation of ∀x ∃y (P(x) → Q(x, y))**

**Step-by-step negation:**
1. Start with: ∀x ∃y (P(x) → Q(x, y))
2. Apply De Morgan's law for quantifiers: ¬∀x = ∃x¬
3. Apply De Morgan's law for quantifiers: ¬∃y = ∀y¬
4. Apply De Morgan's law for implication: ¬(P(x) → Q(x, y)) = P(x) ∧ ¬Q(x, y)
5. Final result: ∃x ∀y (P(x) ∧ ¬Q(x, y))

**Verification:**
- Original: "For every x, there exists a y such that if P(x) then Q(x,y)"
- Negation: "There exists an x such that for every y, P(x) is true and Q(x,y) is false"

**Solution 3: Argument Validity**

**Premise 1:** ∀x (Student(x) → Studies(x))
**Premise 2:** ∃x (Student(x) ∧ Smart(x))
**Conclusion:** ∃x (Studies(x) ∧ Smart(x))

**Analysis:**
This argument is **valid**.

**Proof:**
1. From Premise 2, we know there exists some student, call them 'a', who is both a student and smart:
   - Student(a) ∧ Smart(a)

2. From Premise 1, since 'a' is a student, we can apply universal instantiation:
   - Student(a) → Studies(a)

3. Since Student(a) is true and Student(a) → Studies(a) is true, by modus ponens:
   - Studies(a) is true

4. Therefore, we have:
   - Studies(a) ∧ Smart(a)

5. This means ∃x (Studies(x) ∧ Smart(x)) is true, which is our conclusion.

**Therefore:** The argument is valid. If the premises are true, the conclusion must be true.

**Historical Context**

Predicate logic emerged in the late 19th century with the work of Gottlob Frege, who developed a formal system for mathematical logic. His Begriffsschrift (Concept Script) introduced the first complete system of predicate logic with quantifiers. Later, Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead expanded on Frege's work in their monumental Principia Mathematica, establishing predicate logic as the foundation of modern mathematical logic.

**Advanced Extensions**

Modern predicate logic extends beyond the basic system to include:
- **Second-order logic:** Quantification over predicates and functions
- **Modal logic:** Adding operators for necessity and possibility
- **Temporal logic:** Reasoning about time and change
- **Description logic:** Specialized logic for knowledge representation in AI
- **Higher-order logic:** Quantification over higher-order objects

These extensions enable more sophisticated reasoning while maintaining the formal rigor that makes predicate logic so powerful for mathematical and computational applications.

### 3. MATHEMATICAL PROOFS & REASONING

#### Direct Proofs and Contrapositive

Mathematical proofs are the heart of mathematical reasoning, providing rigorous demonstrations that statements are true. A proof is a logical argument that establishes the truth of a mathematical statement beyond any doubt.

**What is a Mathematical Proof?**

A mathematical proof is a sequence of logical steps that demonstrates the truth of a mathematical statement. Each step must follow logically from previous steps, using accepted mathematical principles, definitions, and previously proven theorems.

**The Structure of a Direct Proof:**

1. **Given:** State what you know (hypotheses, definitions, axioms)
2. **To Prove:** State what you want to show
3. **Proof:** Provide logical steps leading from given to conclusion
4. **Therefore:** State the conclusion

**Example: Direct Proof**

**Theorem:** If n is an even integer, then n² is even.

**Proof:**
- **Given:** n is an even integer
- **To Prove:** n² is even
- **Proof:** 
  - Since n is even, n = 2k for some integer k (definition of even)
  - Then n² = (2k)² = 4k² = 2(2k²)
  - Since 2k² is an integer, n² = 2 × (integer)
  - Therefore, n² is even (definition of even)
- **Therefore:** n² is even

**The Contrapositive Method:**

The contrapositive of "if P then Q" is "if not Q then not P." These statements are logically equivalent, so proving the contrapositive proves the original statement.

**Example: Proof by Contrapositive**

**Theorem:** If n² is odd, then n is odd.

**Proof:** We prove the contrapositive: "If n is even, then n² is even."
- **Given:** n is even
- **To Prove:** n² is even
- **Proof:** 
  - Since n is even, n = 2k for some integer k
  - Then n² = (2k)² = 4k² = 2(2k²)
  - Since 2k² is an integer, n² = 2 × (integer)
  - Therefore, n² is even
- **Therefore:** The contrapositive is true, so the original statement is true

**Key Insight:** The contrapositive is often easier to prove than the original statement, especially when the conclusion involves negation.

#### Proof by Contradiction

Proof by contradiction (reductio ad absurdum) is a powerful technique where we assume the opposite of what we want to prove and show this leads to a logical contradiction.

**The Method:**
1. Assume the opposite of what you want to prove
2. Use logical reasoning to derive a contradiction
3. Conclude that your assumption must be false
4. Therefore, the original statement must be true

**Example: Proof by Contradiction**

**Theorem:** √2 is irrational.

**Proof:**
- **Given:** √2 is a real number
- **To Prove:** √2 is irrational
- **Proof:** 
  - Assume, for contradiction, that √2 is rational
  - Then √2 = p/q where p and q are integers with no common factors
  - Squaring both sides: 2 = p²/q²
  - Multiplying by q²: 2q² = p²
  - This means p² is even, so p must be even (if p were odd, p² would be odd)
  - Since p is even, p = 2k for some integer k
  - Substituting: 2q² = (2k)² = 4k²
  - Dividing by 2: q² = 2k²
  - This means q² is even, so q must be even
  - But if both p and q are even, they have 2 as a common factor
  - This contradicts our assumption that p and q have no common factors
- **Therefore:** √2 is irrational

**Why Proof by Contradiction Works:**

When we assume the opposite of what we want to prove and reach a contradiction, we've shown that the opposite assumption is impossible. This means our original statement must be true.

**Common Contradictions to Look For:**
- A = B and A ≠ B (logical contradiction)
- A number is both even and odd
- A set is both finite and infinite
- A function is both injective and not injective

#### Mathematical Induction

Mathematical induction is a powerful technique for proving statements about all natural numbers. It's based on the principle that if a statement is true for the first natural number and if it being true for any natural number implies it's true for the next, then it's true for all natural numbers.

**The Principle of Mathematical Induction:**

To prove that P(n) is true for all natural numbers n ≥ n₀:

1. **Base Case:** Prove P(n₀) is true
2. **Inductive Step:** Prove that if P(k) is true for some k ≥ n₀, then P(k+1) is true
3. **Conclusion:** By the principle of induction, P(n) is true for all n ≥ n₀

**Example: Mathematical Induction**

**Theorem:** For all natural numbers n ≥ 1, 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = n(n+1)/2

**Proof:**
- **Base Case (n = 1):** 
  - Left side: 1
  - Right side: 1(1+1)/2 = 1
  - Since 1 = 1, the statement is true for n = 1

- **Inductive Step:** 
  - Assume the statement is true for n = k: 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k = k(k+1)/2
  - We need to show it's true for n = k+1
  - Consider 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k + (k+1)
  - By our assumption: 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k + (k+1) = k(k+1)/2 + (k+1)
  - Factoring: = (k+1)(k/2 + 1) = (k+1)(k+2)/2
  - This is exactly the formula for n = k+1

- **Conclusion:** By mathematical induction, the statement is true for all n ≥ 1

**Strong Induction:**

Strong induction is a variation where we assume P(j) is true for all j from n₀ to k, not just for k.

**Example: Strong Induction**

**Theorem:** Every natural number n ≥ 2 can be written as a product of prime numbers.

**Proof:**
- **Base Case (n = 2):** 2 is prime, so it's a product of primes (itself)

- **Inductive Step:** 
  - Assume every number from 2 to k can be written as a product of primes
  - Consider k+1
  - If k+1 is prime, we're done
  - If k+1 is composite, then k+1 = ab where 2 ≤ a, b ≤ k
  - By our assumption, both a and b can be written as products of primes
  - Therefore, k+1 = ab is also a product of primes

- **Conclusion:** By strong induction, every natural number n ≥ 2 can be written as a product of primes

#### Constructive vs. Non-Constructive Proofs

**Constructive Proofs:**

A constructive proof not only shows that something exists but also provides a method to find or construct it.

**Example: Constructive Proof**

**Theorem:** There exists a rational number between any two irrational numbers.

**Proof:**
- Let a and b be irrational numbers with a < b
- Consider the number (a + b)/2
- Since a < b, we have a < (a + b)/2 < b
- The average of two irrational numbers is rational
- Therefore, (a + b)/2 is a rational number between a and b

**Non-Constructive Proofs:**

A non-constructive proof shows that something exists without providing a method to find it.

**Example: Non-Constructive Proof**

**Theorem:** There exist irrational numbers a and b such that aᵇ is rational.

**Proof:**
- Consider √2^√2
- If √2^√2 is rational, we're done (let a = b = √2)
- If √2^√2 is irrational, then (√2^√2)^√2 = √2^(√2 × √2) = √2² = 2
- Since 2 is rational, we're done (let a = √2^√2 and b = √2)
- Therefore, such numbers exist

**Key Insight:** This proof shows existence without telling us which pair of numbers works!

#### Proof Strategies and Heuristics

**General Proof Strategies:**

1. **Understand the Problem:** Read carefully, identify what's given and what's to be proved
2. **Look for Patterns:** Identify similarities to problems you've seen before
3. **Try Special Cases:** Test with small numbers or simple examples
4. **Work Backwards:** Start with what you want to prove and work backwards
5. **Draw Pictures:** Visual representations often reveal key insights

**Specific Techniques:**

**1. Cases Analysis:**
Break the problem into different cases and handle each separately.

**Example:** Prove that for any integer n, n² + n + 1 is never divisible by 3.

**Proof:** Consider three cases:
- **Case 1:** n ≡ 0 (mod 3)
  - Then n² + n + 1 ≡ 0 + 0 + 1 ≡ 1 (mod 3)
- **Case 2:** n ≡ 1 (mod 3)
  - Then n² + n + 1 ≡ 1 + 1 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 3)
- **Case 3:** n ≡ 2 (mod 3)
  - Then n² + n + 1 ≡ 4 + 2 + 1 ≡ 7 ≡ 1 (mod 3)
- Since the result is never 0 (mod 3), the expression is never divisible by 3

**2. Existence Proofs:**
- **Constructive:** Build the object explicitly
- **Non-constructive:** Show it must exist without building it
- **Probabilistic:** Show it exists with high probability

**3. Uniqueness Proofs:**
- Assume two objects satisfy the condition
- Show they must be equal
- Conclude uniqueness

**Example: Uniqueness Proof**

**Theorem:** The solution to the equation 2x + 3 = 7 is unique.

**Proof:**
- **Existence:** x = 2 is a solution since 2(2) + 3 = 7
- **Uniqueness:** Suppose x₁ and x₂ are both solutions
- Then 2x₁ + 3 = 7 and 2x₂ + 3 = 7
- Subtracting: 2x₁ + 3 - (2x₂ + 3) = 7 - 7
- Simplifying: 2(x₁ - x₂) = 0
- Since 2 ≠ 0, we must have x₁ - x₂ = 0
- Therefore, x₁ = x₂
- **Conclusion:** The solution is unique

**Common Proof Mistakes:**

1. **Circular Reasoning:** Using what you're trying to prove
2. **Assuming the Converse:** If P → Q, don't assume Q → P
3. **Insufficient Base Cases:** Induction needs proper base cases
4. **Handwaving:** Skipping important logical steps
5. **Not Checking All Cases:** Missing important scenarios

**Real-World Application: Computer Science**

Proof techniques are essential in computer science for:
- **Algorithm Correctness:** Proving algorithms work correctly
- **Program Verification:** Ensuring software meets specifications
- **Complexity Analysis:** Understanding algorithm efficiency
- **Security Proofs:** Demonstrating cryptographic protocols are secure

**Example: Algorithm Correctness**

**Algorithm:** Find the maximum element in an array

**Proof of Correctness:**
- **Base Case:** Array with one element - algorithm returns that element
- **Inductive Step:** Assume algorithm works for arrays of size k
- For array of size k+1, algorithm compares first k elements (by induction, finds max) with the (k+1)th element
- Returns the larger of the two
- **Conclusion:** Algorithm works for all array sizes

**Practice Problems**

1. **Direct Proof:** Prove that if n is odd, then n² - 1 is divisible by 8.

2. **Contrapositive:** Prove that if n² is not divisible by 4, then n is odd.

3. **Contradiction:** Prove that there are infinitely many prime numbers.

4. **Induction:** Prove that 1³ + 2³ + 3³ + ... + n³ = [n(n+1)/2]² for all n ≥ 1.

5. **Cases:** Prove that for any integer n, n³ - n is divisible by 6.

**Solutions:**

**Solution 1: Direct Proof - If n is odd, then n² - 1 is divisible by 8**

**Proof:**
Let n be an odd integer. Then n = 2k + 1 for some integer k.

n² - 1 = (2k + 1)² - 1
        = 4k² + 4k + 1 - 1
        = 4k² + 4k
        = 4k(k + 1)

Now, k(k + 1) is always even because either k or k + 1 must be even.
Let k(k + 1) = 2m for some integer m.

Then n² - 1 = 4 × 2m = 8m, which is divisible by 8.

**Solution 2: Contrapositive - If n² is not divisible by 4, then n is odd**

**Proof:** We prove the contrapositive: "If n is even, then n² is divisible by 4."

If n is even, then n = 2k for some integer k.
Then n² = (2k)² = 4k², which is clearly divisible by 4.

Since the contrapositive is true, the original statement is true.

**Solution 3: Contradiction - There are infinitely many prime numbers**

**Proof:** Assume for contradiction that there are only finitely many primes.
Let p₁, p₂, ..., pₖ be all the primes.

Consider the number N = p₁ × p₂ × ... × pₖ + 1.

Since N > 1, it must have a prime factor. But N is not divisible by any of the primes p₁, p₂, ..., pₖ (it leaves remainder 1 when divided by any of them).

This contradicts our assumption that we listed all primes.
Therefore, there must be infinitely many primes.

**Solution 4: Mathematical Induction - 1³ + 2³ + 3³ + ... + n³ = [n(n+1)/2]²**

**Base Case (n = 1):**
Left side: 1³ = 1
Right side: [1(1+1)/2]² = [1×2/2]² = 1² = 1 ✓

**Inductive Step:**
Assume the formula holds for n = k:
1³ + 2³ + ... + k³ = [k(k+1)/2]²

We need to show it holds for n = k + 1:
1³ + 2³ + ... + k³ + (k+1)³ = [(k+1)(k+2)/2]²

By the inductive hypothesis:
[k(k+1)/2]² + (k+1)³ = [(k+1)(k+2)/2]²

Let's verify this algebraically:
Left side: [k(k+1)/2]² + (k+1)³
         = k²(k+1)²/4 + (k+1)³
         = (k+1)²[k²/4 + (k+1)]
         = (k+1)²[k² + 4k + 4]/4
         = (k+1)²(k+2)²/4
         = [(k+1)(k+2)/2]² ✓

**Solution 5: Proof by Cases - n³ - n is divisible by 6 for any integer n**

**Proof:** We'll show that n³ - n is divisible by both 2 and 3.

First, factor: n³ - n = n(n² - 1) = n(n-1)(n+1)

**Divisibility by 2:**
Among any three consecutive integers n-1, n, n+1, one must be even.
Therefore, n(n-1)(n+1) is divisible by 2.

**Divisibility by 3:**
Among any three consecutive integers n-1, n, n+1, one must be divisible by 3.
Therefore, n(n-1)(n+1) is divisible by 3.

Since n³ - n is divisible by both 2 and 3, and 2 and 3 are coprime, it follows that n³ - n is divisible by 6.

**Historical Context**

The concept of mathematical proof dates back to ancient Greece, with Euclid's Elements (c. 300 BCE) establishing the axiomatic method. The development of formal logic in the 19th and 20th centuries led to rigorous proof theory, with mathematicians like David Hilbert, Kurt Gödel, and Alan Turing making fundamental contributions to our understanding of what can and cannot be proven.

**Advanced Extensions**

Modern proof theory includes:
- **Proof Complexity:** Measuring the length and complexity of proofs
- **Automated Theorem Proving:** Using computers to find proofs
- **Interactive Proofs:** Protocols where a prover convinces a verifier
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs:** Proving something without revealing how
- **Constructive Mathematics:** Mathematics that only accepts constructive proofs

These developments continue to expand the boundaries of what we can prove and how we prove it, making mathematical reasoning an ever-evolving field of study.

### 4. SET THEORY & RELATIONS

#### Set Operations and Properties

Set theory provides the foundation for modern mathematics, offering a unified language to describe collections of objects and their relationships. Sets are fundamental building blocks that appear throughout mathematics, from basic arithmetic to advanced abstract algebra.

**What is a Set?**

A set is a collection of distinct objects, called elements or members, considered as a single entity. Sets are typically denoted by capital letters, and their elements are listed between curly braces or described by a property.

**Notation and Examples:**
- **Roster Notation:** A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
- **Set-Builder Notation:** B = {x | x is an even integer}
- **Descriptive Notation:** C = the set of all prime numbers

**Special Sets:**
- **Empty Set:** ∅ = {} (contains no elements)
- **Universal Set:** U (contains all objects under consideration)
- **Natural Numbers:** ℕ = {1, 2, 3, 4, ...}
- **Integers:** ℤ = {..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...}
- **Rational Numbers:** ℚ = {p/q | p, q ∈ ℤ, q ≠ 0}
- **Real Numbers:** ℝ (all numbers on the number line)

**Set Membership:**
- x ∈ A means "x is an element of set A"
- x ∉ A means "x is not an element of set A"

**Example:** If A = {2, 4, 6, 8}, then 4 ∈ A and 5 ∉ A.

#### Basic Set Operations

**Union (∪):**
The union of two sets A and B is the set of all elements that belong to A, B, or both.

**Definition:** A ∪ B = {x | x ∈ A or x ∈ B}

**Example:** If A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {3, 4, 5}, then A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

**Intersection (∩):**
The intersection of two sets A and B is the set of all elements that belong to both A and B.

**Definition:** A ∩ B = {x | x ∈ A and x ∈ B}

**Example:** If A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {3, 4, 5}, then A ∩ B = {3}

**Set Difference (- or \):**
The difference of sets A and B is the set of elements in A that are not in B.

**Definition:** A - B = {x | x ∈ A and x ∉ B}

**Example:** If A = {1, 2, 3, 4} and B = {3, 4, 5}, then A - B = {1, 2}

**Complement (A' or Ā):**
The complement of set A (relative to universal set U) is the set of all elements in U that are not in A.

**Definition:** A' = {x | x ∈ U and x ∉ A}

**Example:** If U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and A = {1, 2}, then A' = {3, 4, 5}

#### Set Properties and Laws

**Commutative Laws:**
- A ∪ B = B ∪ A
- A ∩ B = B ∩ A

**Associative Laws:**
- (A ∪ B) ∪ C = A ∪ (B ∪ C)
- (A ∩ B) ∩ C = A ∩ (B ∩ C)

**Distributive Laws:**
- A ∪ (B ∩ C) = (A ∪ B) ∩ (A ∪ C)
- A ∩ (B ∪ C) = (A ∩ B) ∪ (A ∩ C)

**De Morgan's Laws:**
- (A ∪ B)' = A' ∩ B'
- (A ∩ B)' = A' ∪ B'

**Identity Laws:**
- A ∪ ∅ = A
- A ∩ U = A

**Domination Laws:**
- A ∪ U = U
- A ∩ ∅ = ∅

**Idempotent Laws:**
- A ∪ A = A
- A ∩ A = A

**Complement Laws:**
- A ∪ A' = U
- A ∩ A' = ∅

#### Cartesian Products and Relations

**Cartesian Product:**
The Cartesian product of two sets A and B is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a ∈ A and b ∈ B.

**Definition:** A × B = {(a, b) | a ∈ A and b ∈ B}

**Example:** If A = {1, 2} and B = {a, b}, then A × B = {(1, a), (1, b), (2, a), (2, b)}

**Key Properties:**
- |A × B| = |A| × |B| (where |S| denotes the cardinality of set S)
- A × B ≠ B × A (unless A = B or one is empty)
- A × ∅ = ∅ × A = ∅

**Generalized Cartesian Product:**
For n sets A₁, A₂, ..., Aₙ, their Cartesian product is:
A₁ × A₂ × ... × Aₙ = {(a₁, a₂, ..., aₙ) | aᵢ ∈ Aᵢ for each i}

**Example:** ℝ³ = ℝ × ℝ × ℝ represents three-dimensional space.

**Binary Relations:**
A binary relation R from set A to set B is a subset of A × B. We write a R b to mean (a, b) ∈ R.

**Types of Relations:**
- **Reflexive:** For all a ∈ A, a R a
- **Irreflexive:** For all a ∈ A, not (a R a)
- **Symmetric:** For all a, b ∈ A, if a R b then b R a
- **Antisymmetric:** For all a, b ∈ A, if a R b and b R a, then a = b
- **Transitive:** For all a, b, c ∈ A, if a R b and b R c, then a R c

**Example: Divisibility Relation**
Let R be the relation "divides" on the set of positive integers.
- **Reflexive:** Every number divides itself
- **Antisymmetric:** If a divides b and b divides a, then a = b
- **Transitive:** If a divides b and b divides c, then a divides c

#### Equivalence Relations and Partitions

**Equivalence Relations:**
An equivalence relation is a relation that is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.

**Example: Congruence Modulo n**
For a fixed positive integer n, define a ≡ b (mod n) if n divides (a - b).
- **Reflexive:** a ≡ a (mod n) because n divides 0
- **Symmetric:** If a ≡ b (mod n), then b ≡ a (mod n)
- **Transitive:** If a ≡ b (mod n) and b ≡ c (mod n), then a ≡ c (mod n)

**Equivalence Classes:**
Given an equivalence relation R on set A, the equivalence class of element a is:
[a] = {x ∈ A | x R a}

**Example: Congruence Classes Modulo 3**
- [0] = {..., -6, -3, 0, 3, 6, ...}
- [1] = {..., -5, -2, 1, 4, 7, ...}
- [2] = {..., -4, -1, 2, 5, 8, ...}

**Partitions:**
A partition of set A is a collection of non-empty, pairwise disjoint subsets whose union is A.

**Theorem:** The equivalence classes of an equivalence relation on A form a partition of A.

**Example: Partition by Remainder**
The set of integers can be partitioned into n subsets based on remainder when divided by n.

#### Functions and Bijections

**Functions:**
A function f from set A to set B is a relation that assigns exactly one element of B to each element of A.

**Notation:** f: A → B
- **Domain:** A (the set of inputs)
- **Codomain:** B (the set of possible outputs)
- **Range:** f(A) = {f(x) | x ∈ A} (the actual outputs)

**Function Properties:**
- **Injective (One-to-One):** Different inputs produce different outputs
- **Surjective (Onto):** Every element in the codomain is an output
- **Bijective (One-to-One and Onto):** Both injective and surjective

**Example: Function Analysis**
Let f: ℝ → ℝ be defined by f(x) = x²
- **Not Injective:** f(2) = f(-2) = 4
- **Not Surjective:** No real number maps to -1
- **Range:** [0, ∞)

**Inverse Functions:**
If f: A → B is bijective, then f has an inverse function f⁻¹: B → A such that:
- f⁻¹(f(x)) = x for all x ∈ A
- f(f⁻¹(y)) = y for all y ∈ B

**Example: Inverse Function**
Let f: ℝ → ℝ be defined by f(x) = 2x + 3
- **Injective:** If f(a) = f(b), then 2a + 3 = 2b + 3, so a = b
- **Surjective:** For any y ∈ ℝ, y = 2x + 3 has solution x = (y - 3)/2
- **Inverse:** f⁻¹(y) = (y - 3)/2

**Composition of Functions:**
If f: A → B and g: B → C, then their composition g ∘ f: A → C is defined by:
(g ∘ f)(x) = g(f(x))

**Example: Function Composition**
Let f(x) = x + 1 and g(x) = x²
- (g ∘ f)(x) = g(f(x)) = g(x + 1) = (x + 1)²
- (f ∘ g)(x) = f(g(x)) = f(x²) = x² + 1

#### Cardinality and Infinite Sets

**Finite Sets:**
A set is finite if it has a finite number of elements. The cardinality |A| is the number of elements in A.

**Example:** If A = {a, b, c}, then |A| = 3.

**Infinite Sets:**
A set is infinite if it is not finite.

**Countably Infinite Sets:**
A set is countably infinite if it can be put into a one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers.

**Examples:**
- **Natural Numbers:** ℕ = {1, 2, 3, 4, ...}
- **Integers:** ℤ = {..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...}
- **Rational Numbers:** ℚ (can be enumerated systematically)

**Uncountably Infinite Sets:**
A set is uncountably infinite if it is infinite but not countably infinite.

**Example: Real Numbers**
The set of real numbers ℝ is uncountably infinite. This was proven by Georg Cantor using his famous diagonalization argument.

**Cardinality Comparisons:**
- |ℕ| = |ℤ| = |ℚ| = ℵ₀ (aleph-null, the cardinality of countably infinite sets)
- |ℝ| = 2^ℵ₀ (the cardinality of the power set of ℕ)

**Power Sets:**
The power set P(A) of set A is the set of all subsets of A.

**Theorem:** |P(A)| = 2^|A|

**Example:** If A = {1, 2}, then P(A) = {∅, {1}, {2}, {1, 2}}, and |P(A)| = 4 = 2².

**Cantor's Theorem:**
For any set A, |A| < |P(A)|. This shows that there are infinitely many different sizes of infinity!

**Real-World Applications:**
- **Database Design:** Sets model data relationships
- **Computer Science:** Sets are fundamental data structures
- **Probability:** Sample spaces are sets
- **Topology:** Open sets define topological spaces
- **Algebra:** Groups, rings, and fields are sets with operations

**Practice Problems:**

1. **Set Operations:** Let A = {1, 2, 3, 4}, B = {3, 4, 5, 6}, and C = {5, 6, 7, 8}. Find:
   - A ∪ B ∪ C
   - A ∩ B ∩ C
   - (A - B) ∪ (B - A)

2. **Cartesian Products:** If |A| = 3 and |B| = 4, what is |A × B|?

3. **Equivalence Relations:** Show that the relation "has the same remainder when divided by 5" is an equivalence relation on the integers.

4. **Functions:** Determine if f: ℝ → ℝ defined by f(x) = x³ is injective, surjective, or bijective.

5. **Cardinality:** Prove that the set of all finite subsets of ℕ is countably infinite.

**Solutions:**

**Solution 1: Set Operations**

**Given:** A = {1, 2, 3, 4}, B = {3, 4, 5, 6}, C = {5, 6, 7, 8}

**a) A ∪ B ∪ C**
A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
(A ∪ B) ∪ C = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}

**b) A ∩ B ∩ C**
A ∩ B = {3, 4}
(A ∩ B) ∩ C = {3, 4} ∩ {5, 6, 7, 8} = ∅

**c) (A - B) ∪ (B - A)**
A - B = {1, 2}
B - A = {5, 6}
(A - B) ∪ (B - A) = {1, 2, 5, 6}

**Solution 2: Cartesian Products**

**Given:** |A| = 3 and |B| = 4

**Formula:** |A × B| = |A| × |B|

**Calculation:** |A × B| = 3 × 4 = 12

**Verification:** If A = {a, b, c} and B = {1, 2, 3, 4}, then:
A × B = {(a,1), (a,2), (a,3), (a,4), (b,1), (b,2), (b,3), (b,4), (c,1), (c,2), (c,3), (c,4)}
Total: 12 ordered pairs ✓

**Solution 3: Equivalence Relations**

**Show:** The relation "has the same remainder when divided by 5" is an equivalence relation on the integers.

**Let R be the relation:** a R b if and only if a ≡ b (mod 5)

**Reflexive:** For any integer a, a ≡ a (mod 5) because 5 divides (a - a) = 0 ✓

**Symmetric:** If a ≡ b (mod 5), then 5 divides (a - b), so 5 divides (b - a), meaning b ≡ a (mod 5) ✓

**Transitive:** If a ≡ b (mod 5) and b ≡ c (mod 5), then:
- 5 divides (a - b), so a - b = 5k for some integer k
- 5 divides (b - c), so b - c = 5m for some integer m
- Adding: (a - b) + (b - c) = a - c = 5k + 5m = 5(k + m)
- Therefore, 5 divides (a - c), so a ≡ c (mod 5) ✓

**Conclusion:** R is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive, so it's an equivalence relation.

**Solution 4: Functions**

**Given:** f: ℝ → ℝ defined by f(x) = x³

**Injective (One-to-One):**
Assume f(a) = f(b), then a³ = b³
Taking cube roots: a = b
Therefore, f is injective ✓

**Surjective (Onto):**
For any y ∈ ℝ, we need to find x such that f(x) = y
Let x = ∛y (cube root of y)
Then f(x) = (∛y)³ = y
Since cube roots exist for all real numbers, f is surjective ✓

**Bijective:** Since f is both injective and surjective, it's bijective ✓

**Solution 5: Cardinality Proof**

**Prove:** The set of all finite subsets of ℕ is countably infinite.

**Strategy:** We'll show this set can be put in one-to-one correspondence with ℕ.

**Method 1: Binary Representation**
For any finite subset S = {n₁, n₂, ..., nₖ} of ℕ, create a binary number:
- Put 1 in position nᵢ if nᵢ ∈ S
- Put 0 in position nᵢ if nᵢ ∉ S

**Example:**
- S = {1, 3, 4} → Binary: ...0001101 (1 in positions 1, 3, 4)
- This binary number represents a unique natural number

**Method 2: Prime Factorization**
For any finite subset S = {n₁, n₂, ..., nₖ}, create a number:
N = 2^n₁ × 3^n₂ × 5^n₃ × ... × pₖ^nₖ
where pᵢ is the i-th prime number.

**Example:**
- S = {1, 3, 4} → N = 2¹ × 3³ × 5⁴ = 2 × 27 × 625 = 33,750

**Conclusion:** Both methods establish a one-to-one correspondence between finite subsets of ℕ and ℕ, proving the set is countably infinite.

**Historical Context:**
Set theory was developed in the late 19th century by Georg Cantor, who introduced the concept of infinite cardinal numbers and proved that there are different sizes of infinity. His work faced significant opposition from mathematicians like Leopold Kronecker, but eventually became fundamental to modern mathematics. Ernst Zermelo and Abraham Fraenkel later developed axiomatic set theory to provide a rigorous foundation.

**Advanced Extensions:**
Modern set theory includes:
- **Axiomatic Set Theory:** ZFC (Zermelo-Fraenkel with Choice)
- **Large Cardinal Axioms:** Extensions beyond standard set theory
- **Forcing:** Technique for independence proofs
- **Descriptive Set Theory:** Study of definable sets of real numbers
- **Model Theory:** Study of mathematical structures and their theories

Set theory continues to be a vibrant area of research, providing the foundation for virtually all of modern mathematics while raising profound questions about the nature of mathematical truth and the limits of what can be proven.

### 5. NUMBER THEORY & ARITHMETIC

#### Divisibility and Prime Numbers

Number theory is the study of the properties of integers, particularly their relationships under operations like addition, multiplication, and division. It's one of the oldest branches of mathematics, with roots in ancient civilizations, yet it continues to be a vibrant area of research with applications in cryptography, computer science, and modern mathematics.

**Divisibility:**
We say that an integer a divides an integer b (written a | b) if there exists an integer k such that b = ak.

**Notation:** a | b means "a divides b" or "a is a divisor of b"

**Examples:**
- 3 | 12 because 12 = 3 × 4
- 5 | 25 because 25 = 5 × 5
- 7 ∤ 20 because there's no integer k with 20 = 7k

**Properties of Divisibility:**
1. **Reflexivity:** a | a for any integer a
2. **Transitivity:** If a | b and b | c, then a | c
3. **Linear Combination:** If a | b and a | c, then a | (mb + nc) for any integers m, n
4. **Bounds:** If a | b and b ≠ 0, then |a| ≤ |b|

**Example: Divisibility Chain**
If 3 | 12 and 12 | 60, then 3 | 60. Also, since 3 | 12 and 3 | 15, we have 3 | (2×12 + 1×15) = 3 | 39.

#### Prime Numbers

**Definition:** A positive integer p > 1 is prime if its only positive divisors are 1 and p itself.

**Examples of Prime Numbers:**
- First few primes: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97
- Note: 2 is the only even prime number

**Composite Numbers:**
A positive integer n > 1 is composite if it's not prime (i.e., it has divisors other than 1 and itself).

**Example:** 15 is composite because 15 = 3 × 5.

**Prime Factorization:**
Every positive integer n > 1 can be written as a product of primes, possibly with repetition.

**Examples:**
- 12 = 2² × 3
- 100 = 2² × 5²
- 2310 = 2 × 3 × 5 × 7 × 11

**Sieve of Eratosthenes:**
An ancient algorithm for finding all primes up to a given limit n:

1. List all numbers from 2 to n
2. Start with the first number (2)
3. Mark all multiples of 2 as composite
4. Move to the next unmarked number (3)
5. Mark all multiples of 3 as composite
6. Continue until you've processed all numbers up to √n
7. Remaining unmarked numbers are prime

**Example: Finding Primes up to 30**
```
2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30
2  3  X  5  X  7  X  9  X  11 X  13 X  15 X  17 X  19 X  21 X  23 X  25 X  27 X  29 X
2  3  X  5  X  7  X  X  X  11 X  13 X  X  X  17 X  19 X  X  X  23 X  X  X  X  29 X
```
Primes up to 30: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29

#### Modular Arithmetic

**Definition:** For integers a, b, and positive integer m, we say a is congruent to b modulo m (written a ≡ b (mod m)) if m | (a - b).

**Alternative Definition:** a ≡ b (mod m) if a and b have the same remainder when divided by m.

**Examples:**
- 17 ≡ 5 (mod 12) because 17 - 5 = 12 and 12 | 12
- 23 ≡ 3 (mod 5) because 23 = 4×5 + 3 and 3 = 0×5 + 3
- -7 ≡ 3 (mod 5) because -7 = (-2)×5 + 3

**Properties of Congruence:**
1. **Reflexivity:** a ≡ a (mod m)
2. **Symmetry:** If a ≡ b (mod m), then b ≡ a (mod m)
3. **Transitivity:** If a ≡ b (mod m) and b ≡ c (mod m), then a ≡ c (mod m)
4. **Addition:** If a ≡ b (mod m) and c ≡ d (mod m), then a + c ≡ b + d (mod m)
5. **Multiplication:** If a ≡ b (mod m) and c ≡ d (mod m), then ac ≡ bd (mod m)

**Example: Modular Arithmetic**
Let's work modulo 7:
- 15 + 23 ≡ 1 + 2 ≡ 3 (mod 7)
- 15 × 23 ≡ 1 × 2 ≡ 2 (mod 7)
- 15² ≡ 1² ≡ 1 (mod 7)

**Modular Inverses:**
A modular inverse of a modulo m is an integer x such that ax ≡ 1 (mod m).

**Example:** Find the modular inverse of 3 modulo 7.
We need 3x ≡ 1 (mod 7). Testing: 3×5 = 15 ≡ 1 (mod 7), so 5 is the inverse of 3 modulo 7.

**Chinese Remainder Theorem:**
If m₁, m₂, ..., mₖ are pairwise coprime integers, then the system of congruences:
x ≡ a₁ (mod m₁)
x ≡ a₂ (mod m₂)
...
x ≡ aₖ (mod mₖ)
has a unique solution modulo M = m₁m₂...mₖ.

**Example: Chinese Remainder Theorem**
Solve: x ≡ 2 (mod 3), x ≡ 3 (mod 5), x ≡ 2 (mod 7)

**Solution:**
- M = 3×5×7 = 105
- For m₁ = 3: M₁ = 35, solve 35y₁ ≡ 1 (mod 3) → y₁ = 2
- For m₂ = 5: M₂ = 21, solve 21y₂ ≡ 1 (mod 5) → y₂ = 1
- For m₃ = 7: M₃ = 15, solve 15y₃ ≡ 1 (mod 7) → y₃ = 1
- x ≡ 2×35×2 + 3×21×1 + 2×15×1 ≡ 140 + 63 + 30 ≡ 233 ≡ 23 (mod 105)

#### Greatest Common Divisors

**Definition:** The greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers a and b, not both zero, is the largest positive integer that divides both a and b.

**Notation:** gcd(a, b) or (a, b)

**Examples:**
- gcd(12, 18) = 6
- gcd(7, 13) = 1
- gcd(0, 5) = 5

**Euclidean Algorithm:**
An efficient method for finding the GCD of two numbers, based on the principle that gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, a mod b).

**Example: Euclidean Algorithm**
Find gcd(48, 18):
```
48 = 2 × 18 + 12
18 = 1 × 12 + 6
12 = 2 × 6 + 0
```
Since the last non-zero remainder is 6, gcd(48, 18) = 6.

**Extended Euclidean Algorithm:**
This algorithm not only finds the GCD but also finds integers x and y such that ax + by = gcd(a, b).

**Example: Extended Euclidean Algorithm**
Find x and y such that 48x + 18y = gcd(48, 18) = 6.

**Working backwards:**
6 = 18 - 1 × 12
  = 18 - 1 × (48 - 2 × 18)
  = 18 - 48 + 2 × 18
  = 3 × 18 - 48
  = 3 × 18 + (-1) × 48

So x = -1 and y = 3.

**Properties of GCD:**
1. **Commutativity:** gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, a)
2. **Associativity:** gcd(gcd(a, b), c) = gcd(a, gcd(b, c))
3. **Distributivity:** gcd(ka, kb) = |k| × gcd(a, b)
4. **Linear Combination:** gcd(a, b) is the smallest positive linear combination of a and b

#### Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic

**Statement:** Every positive integer n > 1 can be written uniquely as a product of primes, up to the order of the factors.

**Uniqueness:** The prime factorization is unique except for the order in which the primes are written.

**Example:**
- 60 = 2² × 3 × 5
- This is the only way to write 60 as a product of primes (ignoring order)

**Proof Sketch:**
1. **Existence:** Use strong induction
2. **Uniqueness:** Use the fact that if a prime p divides a product ab, then p divides a or p divides b

**Applications:**
- **Number of Divisors:** If n = p₁^a₁ × p₂^a₂ × ... × pₖ^aₖ, then the number of positive divisors is (a₁ + 1)(a₂ + 1)...(aₖ + 1)
- **Sum of Divisors:** The sum of positive divisors is (p₁^(a₁+1) - 1)/(p₁ - 1) × (p₂^(a₂+1) - 1)/(p₂ - 1) × ... × (pₖ^(aₖ+1) - 1)/(pₖ - 1)

**Example: Divisors of 60**
- 60 = 2² × 3¹ × 5¹
- Number of divisors: (2+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 3×2×2 = 12
- Divisors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, 60

#### Diophantine Equations

**Definition:** A Diophantine equation is an equation where we seek integer solutions.

**Linear Diophantine Equations:**
Equations of the form ax + by = c, where a, b, c are integers and we seek integer solutions (x, y).

**Theorem:** The equation ax + by = c has integer solutions if and only if gcd(a, b) | c.

**Example: Linear Diophantine Equation**
Solve: 15x + 21y = 12

**Solution:**
- gcd(15, 21) = 3
- Since 3 | 12, solutions exist
- Divide by 3: 5x + 7y = 4
- Using extended Euclidean algorithm: 5×(-2) + 7×2 = 1
- Multiply by 4: 5×(-8) + 7×8 = 4
- General solution: x = -8 + 7k, y = 8 - 5k for any integer k

**Pell's Equation:**
Equations of the form x² - Dy² = 1, where D is a non-square positive integer.

**Example: Pell's Equation**
x² - 2y² = 1

**Solutions:**
- (x, y) = (1, 0)
- (x, y) = (3, 2)
- (x, y) = (17, 12)
- (x, y) = (99, 70)
- And infinitely many more...

**Fermat's Last Theorem:**
The equation xⁿ + yⁿ = zⁿ has no positive integer solutions for n > 2.

**Historical Note:** This was conjectured by Pierre de Fermat in 1637 and finally proven by Andrew Wiles in 1994, after 357 years!

#### Advanced Topics

**Prime Number Theorems:**
- **Prime Number Theorem:** The number of primes ≤ x is approximately x/ln(x)
- **Bertrand's Postulate:** For any n > 1, there's always a prime p with n < p < 2n

**Distribution of Primes:**
- Primes become less frequent as numbers get larger

**Special Types of Primes:**
- **Mersenne Primes:** Primes of the form 2^p - 1

**Practice Problems:**

1. **Divisibility:** Show that if n is odd, then 8 | (n² - 1).

2. **Prime Factorization:** Find the prime factorization of 1001.

3. **Modular Arithmetic:** Solve 7x ≡ 3 (mod 11).

4. **GCD:** Use the Euclidean algorithm to find gcd(12345, 67890).

5. **Diophantine Equation:** Find all positive integer solutions to 3x + 5y = 100.

6. **Prime Testing:** Show that 101 is prime using trial division.

**Solutions:**

**Solution 1: Divisibility Proof**

**Prove:** If n is odd, then 8 | (n² - 1)

**Proof:**
Let n be an odd integer. Then n = 2k + 1 for some integer k.

n² - 1 = (2k + 1)² - 1
        = 4k² + 4k + 1 - 1
        = 4k² + 4k
        = 4k(k + 1)

Now, k(k + 1) is always even because either k or k + 1 must be even.
Let k(k + 1) = 2m for some integer m.

Then n² - 1 = 4 × 2m = 8m, which is divisible by 8.

**Solution 2: Prime Factorization**

**Find:** Prime factorization of 1001

**Method:** Trial division by primes

1001 ÷ 7 = 143 (remainder 0)
143 ÷ 11 = 13 (remainder 0)
13 ÷ 13 = 1 (remainder 0)

**Therefore:** 1001 = 7 × 11 × 13

**Verification:** 7 × 11 × 13 = 77 × 13 = 1001 ✓

**Solution 3: Modular Arithmetic**

**Solve:** 7x ≡ 3 (mod 11)

**Method:** Find modular inverse of 7 modulo 11

**Step 1:** Find x such that 7x ≡ 1 (mod 11)
Trial: 7 × 8 = 56 ≡ 1 (mod 11) ✓

**Step 2:** Multiply both sides by 8:
8 × 7x ≡ 8 × 3 (mod 11)
x ≡ 24 (mod 11)
x ≡ 2 (mod 11)

**Therefore:** x ≡ 2 (mod 11)
**General solution:** x = 2 + 11k for any integer k

**Verification:** 7 × 2 = 14 ≡ 3 (mod 11) ✓

**Solution 4: Euclidean Algorithm**

**Find:** gcd(12345, 67890)

**Euclidean Algorithm:**
67890 = 5 × 12345 + 6165
12345 = 2 × 6165 + 15
6165 = 411 × 15 + 0

**Therefore:** gcd(12345, 67890) = 15

**Verification:** 15 divides both 12345 and 67890 ✓

**Solution 5: Diophantine Equation**

**Find:** All positive integer solutions to 3x + 5y = 100

**Method:** Use extended Euclidean algorithm

**Step 1:** Find particular solution
3x + 5y = 100
By inspection: x = 0, y = 20 is a solution

**Step 2:** Find general solution
Since gcd(3,5) = 1, general solution is:
x = 0 + 5k
y = 20 - 3k

**Step 3:** Find positive solutions
x > 0: 5k > 0 → k > 0
y > 0: 20 - 3k > 0 → k < 20/3 ≈ 6.67

**Therefore:** k = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

**Solutions:**
- k = 1: x = 5, y = 17
- k = 2: x = 10, y = 14
- k = 3: x = 15, y = 11
- k = 4: x = 20, y = 8
- k = 5: x = 25, y = 5
- k = 6: x = 30, y = 2

**Solution 6: Prime Testing**

**Show:** 101 is prime using trial division

**Method:** Test divisibility by primes ≤ √101 ≈ 10.05

**Test primes ≤ 10:**
- 2: 101 is odd, so 2 ∤ 101
- 3: 101 ÷ 3 = 33.67... (not divisible)
- 5: 101 ends in 1, so 5 ∤ 101
- 7: 101 ÷ 7 = 14.43... (not divisible)

**Conclusion:** Since 101 is not divisible by any prime ≤ √101, and 101 > 1, it follows that 101 is prime.

**Historical Context:**
Number theory has fascinated mathematicians for millennia. Ancient civilizations like the Babylonians, Egyptians, and Greeks studied number properties. Diophantus of Alexandria (c. 250 CE) wrote "Arithmetica," which introduced many concepts still studied today. Pierre de Fermat, Leonhard Euler, Carl Friedrich Gauss, and many others made fundamental contributions. Modern number theory includes algebraic number theory, analytic number theory, and computational number theory.

**Open Problems:**
- **Goldbach's Conjecture:** Every even integer > 2 can be written as the sum of two primes
- **Twin Prime Conjecture:** There are infinitely many twin primes
- **Riemann Hypothesis:** A conjecture about the distribution of prime numbers
- **Collatz Conjecture:** A simple iterative process that remains unproven

Number theory continues to be one of the most active areas of mathematical research, combining beautiful theoretical results with practical applications in modern technology.

## 6. COMBINATORICS & PROBABILITY

### 6.1 Basic Counting Principles

The foundation of combinatorics lies in understanding how to count objects systematically. The fundamental counting principle states that if there are m ways to do one thing and n ways to do another, then there are m × n ways to do both.

**Example: Restaurant Menu**
If a restaurant offers 3 appetizers, 5 main courses, and 4 desserts, the total number of possible three-course meals is:
3 × 5 × 4 = 60 different combinations

**Addition Principle**
When counting objects that can be categorized into mutually exclusive groups, we add the counts:
If there are m objects of type A and n objects of type B, and no object is both A and B, then there are m + n total objects.

**Multiplication Principle**
When counting ordered arrangements or combinations of choices, we multiply:
If there are m ways to make the first choice and n ways to make the second choice, then there are m × n total ways to make both choices.

### 6.2 Permutations

A permutation is an ordered arrangement of objects. The number of permutations of n distinct objects is n! (n factorial).

**Factorial Definition**
n! = n × (n-1) × (n-2) × ... × 2 × 1
By convention, 0! = 1

**Example: Arranging Books**
How many ways can you arrange 4 different books on a shelf?
4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24 different arrangements

**Permutations of Subsets**
The number of ways to arrange r objects from a set of n distinct objects is:
P(n,r) = n!/(n-r)!

**Example: Committee Positions**
From 8 people, how many ways can you choose a president, vice-president, and secretary?
P(8,3) = 8!/(8-3)! = 8!/5! = 8 × 7 × 6 = 336 ways

**Permutations with Repetition**
When objects can be repeated, the number of arrangements is n^r.

**Example: Password Combinations**
A 4-digit PIN using digits 0-9:
10^4 = 10,000 possible combinations

### 6.3 Combinations

A combination is an unordered selection of objects. The number of ways to choose r objects from n distinct objects is:
C(n,r) = n!/(r!(n-r)!)

**Combination Formula Properties**
- C(n,r) = C(n,n-r) (symmetry)
- C(n,0) = C(n,n) = 1
- C(n,1) = C(n,n-1) = n

**Example: Committee Selection**
How many ways can you choose a committee of 3 people from 8 people?
C(8,3) = 8!/(3!5!) = (8×7×6)/(3×2×1) = 56 ways

**Pascal's Triangle**
The binomial coefficients C(n,r) can be arranged in Pascal's triangle:
```
    1
   1 1
  1 2 1
 1 3 3 1
1 4 6 4 1
```

Each number is the sum of the two numbers above it.

### 6.4 Binomial Theorem

The binomial theorem expands (a + b)^n:
(a + b)^n = Σ C(n,k) × a^(n-k) × b^k for k = 0 to n

**Example: (x + y)^3**
(x + y)^3 = C(3,0)x^3 + C(3,1)x^2y + C(3,2)xy^2 + C(3,3)y^3
= x^3 + 3x^2y + 3xy^2 + y^3

**Applications**
- Probability calculations
- Algebraic expansions
- Combinatorial identities

### 6.5 Basic Probability Concepts

Probability measures the likelihood of an event occurring. The probability of an event A is:
P(A) = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)

**Probability Axioms**
1. P(A) ≥ 0 for any event A
2. P(S) = 1 for the sample space S
3. P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) for mutually exclusive events

**Example: Coin Toss**
Probability of getting heads on a fair coin:
P(Heads) = 1/2 = 0.5

**Complement Rule**
P(A') = 1 - P(A), where A' is the complement of A

**Example: Rolling a Die**
Probability of NOT rolling a 6:
P(Not 6) = 1 - P(6) = 1 - 1/6 = 5/6

### 6.6 Conditional Probability

Conditional probability is the probability of an event given that another event has occurred:
P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B)

**Example: Drawing Cards**
From a standard deck, what's the probability of drawing a king given that you drew a face card?
P(King|Face Card) = P(King ∩ Face Card) / P(Face Card)
= (4/52) / (12/52) = 4/12 = 1/3

**Multiplication Rule**
P(A ∩ B) = P(A) × P(B|A) = P(B) × P(A|B)

**Example: Sequential Events**
Probability of drawing two aces in a row (without replacement):
P(First Ace) = 4/52
P(Second Ace|First Ace) = 3/51
P(Both Aces) = (4/52) × (3/51) = 12/2652 ≈ 0.0045

### 6.7 Independence

Two events A and B are independent if:
P(A ∩ B) = P(A) × P(B)
or equivalently: P(A|B) = P(A)

**Example: Coin Tosses**
The probability of getting heads on the second toss is independent of the first toss:
P(Heads on 2nd) = 1/2 regardless of the first outcome

**Dependent Events Example**
Drawing cards without replacement creates dependent events:
P(Second card is ace) depends on what the first card was

### 6.8 Bayes' Theorem

Bayes' theorem relates conditional probabilities:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) × P(A) / P(B)

**Example: Medical Testing**
Suppose a disease affects 1% of the population. A test is 95% accurate (5% false positive/negative rate).

If you test positive, what's the probability you actually have the disease?

P(Disease|Positive) = P(Positive|Disease) × P(Disease) / P(Positive)
= 0.95 × 0.01 / (0.95 × 0.01 + 0.05 × 0.99)
= 0.0095 / 0.059 = 0.161

So even with a positive test, there's only about a 16% chance of having the disease!

### 6.9 Random Variables

A random variable is a function that assigns numerical values to outcomes of a random experiment.

**Discrete Random Variables**
Take on countable values (e.g., number of heads in coin tosses)

**Continuous Random Variables**
Take on uncountable values (e.g., height, time, temperature)

**Probability Mass Function (PMF)**
For discrete X: p(x) = P(X = x)

**Probability Density Function (PDF)**
For continuous X: P(a ≤ X ≤ b) = ∫ f(x)dx from a to b

### 6.10 Expected Value and Variance

**Expected Value (Mean)**
E[X] = Σ x × P(X = x) for discrete X
E[X] = ∫ x × f(x)dx for continuous X

**Example: Dice Roll**
Expected value of rolling a fair die:
E[X] = 1×(1/6) + 2×(1/6) + ... + 6×(1/6) = 21/6 = 3.5

**Variance**
Var(X) = E[(X - E[X])^2] = E[X^2] - (E[X])^2

**Standard Deviation**
σ = √Var(X)

**Example: Coin Toss Variance**
For a fair coin (X = 1 for heads, 0 for tails):
E[X] = 0.5
E[X^2] = 0.5
Var(X) = 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25
σ = √0.25 = 0.5

### 6.11 Common Probability Distributions

**Binomial Distribution**
Models the number of successes in n independent trials with probability p of success:
P(X = k) = C(n,k) × p^k × (1-p)^(n-k)

**Example: Multiple Coin Tosses**
Probability of getting exactly 3 heads in 5 tosses:
P(X = 3) = C(5,3) × (0.5)^3 × (0.5)^2 = 10 × 0.125 × 0.25 = 0.3125

**Poisson Distribution**
Models rare events occurring independently:
P(X = k) = (λ^k × e^(-λ)) / k!

**Example: Customer Arrivals**
If customers arrive at a rate of 2 per hour, probability of 3 arrivals in an hour:
P(X = 3) = (2^3 × e^(-2)) / 3! = (8 × 0.135) / 6 = 0.18

**Normal Distribution**
Bell-shaped curve described by mean μ and standard deviation σ:
f(x) = (1/(σ√(2π))) × e^(-((x-μ)^2)/(2σ^2))

### 6.12 Real-World Applications

- Lottery and gambling calculations
- Sports tournament scheduling
- DNA sequence analysis
- Network routing algorithms

**Probability Applications**
- Risk assessment and insurance
- Quality control and manufacturing
- Financial modeling and investment
- Weather forecasting
- Medical diagnosis and treatment

**Example: Password Security**
A password with 8 characters using:
- Lowercase letters (26): 26^8 = 208 billion possibilities
- Lowercase + uppercase (52): 52^8 = 53 trillion possibilities
- Lowercase + uppercase + digits (62): 62^8 = 218 trillion possibilities
- Lowercase + uppercase + digits + symbols (95): 95^8 = 6.6 quadrillion possibilities

### 6.13 Practice Problems

**Problem 1: Committee Formation**
How many ways can you form a committee of 4 people from 10 people if:
a) Order matters (president, vice-president, secretary, treasurer)?
b) Order doesn't matter?

**Solution 1a: Order Matters**
This is a permutation problem since the positions are distinct.
P(10,4) = 10!/(10-4)! = 10!/6! = 10×9×8×7 = 5,040 ways

**Solution 1b: Order Doesn't Matter**
This is a combination problem since we're just selecting people.
C(10,4) = 10!/(4!×6!) = (10×9×8×7)/(4×3×2×1) = 210 ways

**Problem 2: Probability Chain**
A bag contains 3 red balls and 7 blue balls. You draw 2 balls without replacement. What's the probability both are red?

**Solution:**
Total balls = 3 + 7 = 10
P(First ball is red) = 3/10
P(Second ball is red | First was red) = 2/9 (since one red ball was removed)
P(Both red) = P(First red) × P(Second red | First red) = (3/10) × (2/9) = 6/90 = 1/15 ≈ 0.067

**Problem 3: Conditional Probability**
In a class of 30 students, 20 study math and 15 study physics. If 10 study both, what's the probability a randomly selected student studies physics given they study math?

**Solution:**
Let M = studies math, P = studies physics
P(M) = 20/30 = 2/3
P(M ∩ P) = 10/30 = 1/3
P(P|M) = P(M ∩ P)/P(M) = (1/3)/(2/3) = 1/2 = 0.5

**Problem 4: Expected Value**
A game costs $5 to play. You roll a die and win $10 if you get a 6, otherwise you win nothing. What's the expected value of playing this game?

**Solution:**
Let X be the net winnings (winnings - cost)
P(X = 5) = P(rolling 6) = 1/6 (win $10, pay $5, net +$5)
P(X = -5) = P(not rolling 6) = 5/6 (win $0, pay $5, net -$5)
E[X] = 5 × (1/6) + (-5) × (5/6) = 5/6 - 25/6 = -20/6 = -$3.33

### 7. GRAPH THEORY & DISCRETE STRUCTURES

### 7.1 Basic Graph Definitions and Types

A graph is a mathematical structure consisting of vertices (nodes) connected by edges. Formally, a graph G = (V, E) where V is the set of vertices and E is the set of edges.

**Graph Types**

- **Multigraph**: Multiple edges allowed between vertices
- **Pseudograph**: Loops and multiple edges allowed

**Example: Social Network**
Vertices represent people, edges represent friendships:

- Directed: A follows B (but B might not follow A back)
- Weighted: Edge weight could represent friendship strength

**Basic Terminology**

### 7.11 Practice Problems

**Problem 1: Graph Traversal**
Given a graph with vertices A, B, C, D, E and edges:
A-B, A-C, B-D, C-E, D-E
Perform BFS and DFS starting from vertex A.

**Solution:**
Graph structure:
```
A -- B -- D
|         |
C -------- E
```

**BFS from A:**
Level 0: A
Level 1: B, C (neighbors of A)
Level 2: D (neighbor of B), E (neighbor of C)
BFS order: A, B, C, D, E

**DFS from A:**
Start at A
Visit B (first unvisited neighbor)
Visit D (neighbor of B)
Backtrack to B (no more unvisited neighbors)
Backtrack to A
Visit C (second unvisited neighbor)
Visit E (neighbor of C)
DFS order: A, B, D, C, E

**Problem 2: Tree Properties**
Prove that a tree with n vertices has exactly n-1 edges.

**Solution:**
Proof by induction:
Base case: n = 1, 0 edges ✓ (1-1 = 0)
Inductive step: Assume true for trees with k vertices
For a tree with k+1 vertices:
- Remove a leaf vertex (degree 1)
- Remaining graph has k vertices and is still a tree
- By inductive hypothesis, it has k-1 edges
- Adding back the leaf adds exactly 1 edge
- Total: (k-1) + 1 = k edges
- For k+1 vertices: k = (k+1) - 1 ✓

**Problem 3: Graph Coloring**
Find the chromatic number of a cycle with 5 vertices.

**Solution:**
A cycle C₅ with 5 vertices:
- Each vertex has degree 2
- Adjacent vertices must have different colors
- For odd cycles, we need 3 colors minimum
- For even cycles, we need 2 colors minimum
- Since 5 is odd, χ(C₅) = 3

Coloring: Color vertices A, C, E with color 1; B, D with color 2; then one more color needed for the remaining vertex.

**Problem 4: Shortest Path**
Find shortest path from A to E in weighted graph:
A --3-- B --2-- E
|       |
4       1
|       |
C --2-- D

**Solution:**
Using Dijkstra's algorithm:
1. Start at A, distance = 0
2. Visit A's neighbors: B (distance 3), C (distance 4)
3. Visit B (smallest unvisited distance 3)
4. From B: E (distance 3+2 = 5), D (distance 3+1 = 4)
5. Visit C (distance 4)
6. From C: D (distance 4+2 = 6, but D already has distance 4)
7. Visit D (distance 4)
8. From D: E (distance 4+1 = 5, but E already has distance 5)
9. Visit E (distance 5)

Shortest path: A → B → E with length 5

**Problem 5: Connectivity**
Determine if removing vertex B disconnects the graph:
A -- B -- C
|         |
D -------- E

**Solution:**
Original graph has edges: A-B, B-C, A-D, D-E
Removing vertex B removes edges A-B and B-C
Remaining edges: A-D, D-E
Remaining vertices: A, C, D, E

Check connectivity:
- A is connected to D via A-D
- D is connected to E via D-E
- C is isolated (no edges remain)

Since C becomes isolated, removing vertex B disconnects the graph.
The graph splits into two components: {A, D, E} and {C}.

## 8. ALGEBRAIC STRUCTURES

Algebraic structures provide the foundation for abstract mathematics and have profound applications in computer science, physics, and engineering. These structures formalize the patterns we observe in arithmetic and extend them to more general mathematical objects.

### 8.1 Groups: Basic Structure and Properties

A **group** is a set G equipped with a binary operation * that satisfies four fundamental axioms:

1. **Closure:** For all a, b ∈ G, a * b ∈ G
2. **Associativity:** For all a, b, c ∈ G, (a * b) * c = a * (b * c)
3. **Identity:** There exists e ∈ G such that for all a ∈ G, e * a = a * e = a
4. **Inverses:** For each a ∈ G, there exists a⁻¹ ∈ G such that a * a⁻¹ = a⁻¹ * a = e

**Examples of Groups:**

**Historical Context:** Group theory emerged from Évariste Galois's work on polynomial equations in the 1830s. Galois showed that the solvability of polynomial equations by radicals depends on the structure of certain groups, leading to the development of abstract algebra.

### 8.2 Rings and Fields: Extending Group Structure

A **ring** is a set R with two binary operations + and × satisfying:

**Solutions:**

**Solution 1: Group Properties**

**Step 1: Verify closure**
- 1 × 1 = 1 ∈ {1, -1, i, -i} ✓
- 1 × (-1) = -1 ∈ {1, -1, i, -i} ✓
- 1 × i = i ∈ {1, -1, i, -i} ✓
- 1 × (-i) = -i ∈ {1, -1, i, -i} ✓
- (-1) × (-1) = 1 ∈ {1, -1, i, -i} ✓
- (-1) × i = -i ∈ {1, -1, i, -i} ✓
- (-1) × (-i) = i ∈ {1, -1, i, -i} ✓
- i × i = -1 ∈ {1, -1, i, -i} ✓
- i × (-i) = 1 ∈ {1, -1, i, -i} ✓
- (-i) × (-i) = -1 ∈ {1, -1, i, -i} ✓

**Step 2: Verify associativity**
Matrix multiplication is associative, so this property holds ✓

**Step 3: Find identity**
1 is the identity element since 1 × a = a × 1 = a for all a ✓

**Step 4: Find inverses**
- 1⁻¹ = 1
- (-1)⁻¹ = -1
- i⁻¹ = -i (since i × (-i) = 1)
- (-i)⁻¹ = i ✓

**Step 5: Find orders**
- Order of 1: 1¹ = 1, so order = 1
- Order of -1: (-1)² = 1, so order = 2
- Order of i: i⁴ = 1, so order = 4
- Order of -i: (-i)⁴ = 1, so order = 4

**Solution 2: Ring Verification**

**Step 1: Verify (M₂(ℤ), +) is an abelian group**
- Closure: Sum of integer matrices has integer entries ✓
- Associativity: Matrix addition is associative ✓
- Identity: Zero matrix [0 0; 0 0] is the additive identity ✓
- Inverses: -A is the additive inverse of A ✓
- Commutativity: A + B = B + A ✓

**Step 2: Verify multiplication is associative**
Matrix multiplication is associative ✓

**Step 3: Verify distributivity**
- A(B + C) = AB + AC ✓
- (A + B)C = AC + BC ✓

**Step 4: Check if it's a field**
Consider A = [1 0; 0 0]. This matrix has no multiplicative inverse because:
- For any matrix B = [a b; c d], AB = [a b; 0 0] ≠ [1 0; 0 1]
- Therefore, M₂(ℤ) is not a field

**Conclusion:** M₂(ℤ) is a ring but not a field.

**Solution 3: Vector Space Basis**

**Step 1: Express general 2×2 symmetric matrix**
A symmetric matrix has the form A = [a b; b c] where a, b, c ∈ ℝ

**Step 2: Find basis vectors**
We can write A = a[1 0; 0 0] + b[0 1; 1 0] + c[0 0; 0 1]

**Step 3: Verify linear independence**
Let α[1 0; 0 0] + β[0 1; 1 0] + γ[0 0; 0 1] = [0 0; 0 0]
This gives [α β; β γ] = [0 0; 0 0]
Therefore, α = β = γ = 0, so the vectors are linearly independent ✓

**Step 4: Verify spanning**
Any symmetric matrix can be written as a linear combination of these three matrices ✓

**Step 5: Determine dimension**
Since we have 3 linearly independent vectors that span the space, the dimension is 3.

**Basis:** {[1 0; 0 0], [0 1; 1 0], [0 0; 0 1]}

**Solution 4: Matrix Diagonalization**

**Step 1: Find characteristic polynomial**
det(A - λI) = det([3-λ 1; 0 2-λ]) = (3-λ)(2-λ) - 0 = (3-λ)(2-λ)

**Step 2: Find eigenvalues**
(3-λ)(2-λ) = 0
λ = 3 or λ = 2

**Step 3: Find eigenvectors for λ = 3**
(A - 3I)v = 0
[0 1; 0 -1][x; y] = [0; 0]
This gives y = 0, x can be any value
Eigenvector: [1; 0]

**Step 4: Find eigenvectors for λ = 2**
(A - 2I)v = 0
[1 1; 0 0][x; y] = [0; 0]
This gives x + y = 0, so y = -x
Eigenvector: [1; -1]

**Step 5: Check diagonalization**
Since A is 2×2 and we found 2 linearly independent eigenvectors, A can be diagonalized.

**Diagonalization:** A = PDP⁻¹ where:
- P = [1 1; 0 -1]
- D = [3 0; 0 2]
- P⁻¹ = [1 1; 0 -1]

**Solution 5: Linear Transformation**

**Step 1: Verify linearity**
Let v₁ = (x₁, y₁, z₁) and v₂ = (x₂, y₂, z₂), and let α, β be scalars.

T(αv₁ + βv₂) = T(αx₁ + βx₂, αy₁ + βy₂, αz₁ + βz₂)
                = (αx₁ + βx₂ + αy₁ + βy₂, αy₁ + βy₂ + αz₁ + βz₂)
                = α(x₁ + y₁, y₁ + z₁) + β(x₂ + y₂, y₂ + z₂)
                = αT(v₁) + βT(v₂) ✓

**Step 2: Find matrix representation**
T: ℝ³ → ℝ² maps (x, y, z) → (x + y, y + z)

The matrix A satisfies A[x; y; z] = [x+y; y+z]

Therefore, A = [1 1 0; 0 1 1]

**Verification:** [1 1 0; 0 1 1][x; y; z] = [x+y; y+z] ✓

The matrix representation of T is A = [1 1 0; 0 1 1].

### 9. CALCULUS & ANALYSIS

#### Introduction to Calculus

Calculus is the mathematical study of continuous change, developed independently by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz in the late 17th century. It provides powerful tools for analyzing functions, rates of change, and accumulation of quantities.

**What is Calculus?**

Calculus consists of two main branches:
- **Differential Calculus**: Studies rates of change and slopes of curves
- **Integral Calculus**: Studies accumulation of quantities and areas under curves

These branches are connected by the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, which shows that differentiation and integration are inverse operations.

#### Limits and Continuity

**The Concept of a Limit**

A limit describes the behavior of a function as the input approaches a particular value. Formally, we say that the limit of f(x) as x approaches a is L, written as:

lim(x→a) f(x) = L

if we can make f(x) arbitrarily close to L by taking x sufficiently close to a (but not equal to a).

**Example: Understanding Limits Intuitively**

Consider the function f(x) = (x² - 1)/(x - 1) when x ≠ 1.

**Step 1: Direct substitution fails**
If we try to evaluate f(1), we get 0/0, which is undefined.

**Step 2: Factor and simplify**
f(x) = (x² - 1)/(x - 1) = (x + 1)(x - 1)/(x - 1) = x + 1 (when x ≠ 1)

**Step 3: Evaluate the limit**
lim(x→1) f(x) = lim(x→1) (x + 1) = 1 + 1 = 2

**Practice Problem 1: Limit Evaluation**
Find lim(x→2) (x³ - 8)/(x - 2)

**Solution:**
**Step 1: Direct substitution gives 0/0**
f(2) = (8 - 8)/(2 - 2) = 0/0 (indeterminate form)

**Step 2: Factor the numerator**
x³ - 8 = x³ - 2³ = (x - 2)(x² + 2x + 4)

**Step 3: Simplify and evaluate**
lim(x→2) (x³ - 8)/(x - 2) = lim(x→2) (x - 2)(x² + 2x + 4)/(x - 2)
                           = lim(x→2) (x² + 2x + 4)
                           = 4 + 4 + 4 = 12

**Answer:** The limit is 12.

**Continuity**

A function f(x) is continuous at a point x = a if:
1. f(a) is defined
2. lim(x→a) f(x) exists
3. lim(x→a) f(x) = f(a)

**Practice Problem 2: Continuity Check**
Determine if f(x) = {x² if x < 2, 4 if x = 2, x + 2 if x > 2} is continuous at x = 2.

**Solution:**
**Step 1: Check if f(2) is defined**
f(2) = 4 ✓

**Step 2: Check left-hand limit**
lim(x→2⁻) f(x) = lim(x→2⁻) x² = 4

**Step 3: Check right-hand limit**
lim(x→2⁺) f(x) = lim(x→2⁺) (x + 2) = 4

**Step 4: Check if limits are equal**
Both left and right limits equal 4 ✓

**Step 5: Check if limit equals function value**
lim(x→2) f(x) = 4 = f(2) ✓

**Answer:** The function is continuous at x = 2.

#### Differentiation and Integration

**The Derivative**

The derivative of a function f(x) at a point x = a measures the instantaneous rate of change of f at that point. It's defined as:

f'(a) = lim(h→0) [f(a + h) - f(a)]/h

**Geometric Interpretation:** The derivative represents the slope of the tangent line to the curve y = f(x) at the point (a, f(a)).

**Basic Differentiation Rules**

1. **Power Rule:** d/dx[xⁿ] = nxⁿ⁻¹
2. **Constant Rule:** d/dx[c] = 0
3. **Sum Rule:** d/dx[f(x) + g(x)] = f'(x) + g'(x)
4. **Product Rule:** d/dx[f(x)g(x)] = f'(x)g(x) + f(x)g'(x)
5. **Quotient Rule:** d/dx[f(x)/g(x)] = [f'(x)g(x) - f(x)g'(x)]/[g(x)]²
6. **Chain Rule:** d/dx[f(g(x))] = f'(g(x))g'(x)

**Practice Problem 3: Derivative Calculation**
Find the derivative of f(x) = (x² + 1)³(2x - 3)

**Solution:**
**Step 1: Identify the structure**
This is a product of two functions: u(x) = (x² + 1)³ and v(x) = (2x - 3)

**Step 2: Apply the product rule**
f'(x) = u'(x)v(x) + u(x)v'(x)

**Step 3: Find u'(x) using chain rule**
u(x) = (x² + 1)³
u'(x) = 3(x² + 1)² · d/dx(x² + 1) = 3(x² + 1)² · 2x = 6x(x² + 1)²

**Step 4: Find v'(x)**
v(x) = 2x - 3
v'(x) = 2

**Step 5: Combine using product rule**
f'(x) = 6x(x² + 1)²(2x - 3) + (x² + 1)³(2)
        = 6x(x² + 1)²(2x - 3) + 2(x² + 1)³
        = 2(x² + 1)²[3x(2x - 3) + (x² + 1)]
        = 2(x² + 1)²[6x² - 9x + x² + 1]
        = 2(x² + 1)²(7x² - 9x + 1)

**Answer:** f'(x) = 2(x² + 1)²(7x² - 9x + 1)

**The Integral**

Integration is the process of finding the antiderivative of a function. The definite integral ∫[a,b] f(x) dx represents the signed area between the curve y = f(x) and the x-axis from x = a to x = b.

**Basic Integration Rules**

1. **Power Rule:** ∫xⁿ dx = xⁿ⁺¹/(n+1) + C (n ≠ -1)
2. **Constant Rule:** ∫c dx = cx + C
3. **Sum Rule:** ∫[f(x) + g(x)] dx = ∫f(x) dx + ∫g(x) dx
4. **Substitution:** ∫f(g(x))g'(x) dx = ∫f(u) du where u = g(x)

**Practice Problem 4: Definite Integral**
Evaluate ∫[0,2] (x³ + 2x) dx

**Solution:**
**Step 1: Find the antiderivative**
∫(x³ + 2x) dx = ∫x³ dx + ∫2x dx = x⁴/4 + x² + C

**Step 2: Apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**
∫[0,2] (x³ + 2x) dx = [x⁴/4 + x²]₀²

**Step 3: Evaluate at the bounds**
[x⁴/4 + x²]₀² = (2⁴/4 + 2²) - (0⁴/4 + 0²)
                 = (16/4 + 4) - (0 + 0)
                 = (4 + 4) - 0
                 = 8

**Answer:** The definite integral equals 8.

#### Series and Sequences

**Sequences**

A sequence is an ordered list of numbers. A sequence {aₙ} converges to a limit L if for every ε > 0, there exists an N such that |aₙ - L| < ε for all n > N.

**Practice Problem 5: Sequence Convergence**
Determine if the sequence {aₙ} = {n/(n + 1)} converges, and if so, find its limit.

**Solution:**
**Step 1: Rewrite the sequence**
aₙ = n/(n + 1) = n/(n(1 + 1/n)) = 1/(1 + 1/n)

**Step 2: Take the limit as n approaches infinity**
lim(n→∞) aₙ = lim(n→∞) 1/(1 + 1/n) = 1/(1 + 0) = 1

**Step 3: Verify convergence**
Since the limit exists and equals 1, the sequence converges to 1.

**Answer:** The sequence converges to 1.

**Series**

A series is the sum of the terms of a sequence. The series Σₙ₌₁^∞ aₙ converges if the sequence of partial sums {Sₙ} converges, where Sₙ = a₁ + a₂ + ... + aₙ.

**Practice Problem 6: Geometric Series**
Find the sum of the infinite geometric series: 1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + ...

**Solution:**
**Step 1: Identify the first term and common ratio**
First term: a = 1
Common ratio: r = 1/2

**Step 2: Check convergence condition**
Since |r| = |1/2| = 1/2 < 1, the series converges.

**Step 3: Apply the geometric series formula**
For |r| < 1, Σₙ₌₀^∞ arⁿ = a/(1 - r)

**Step 4: Calculate the sum**
Sum = 1/(1 - 1/2) = 1/(1/2) = 2

**Answer:** The sum of the infinite series is 2.

#### Multivariable Calculus

**Partial Derivatives**

For a function of multiple variables, we can take partial derivatives with respect to each variable while treating the others as constants.

**Practice Problem 7: Partial Derivatives**
Find ∂f/∂x and ∂f/∂y for f(x, y) = x²y + xy² + sin(xy)

**Solution:**
**Step 1: Find ∂f/∂x (treat y as constant)**
∂f/∂x = ∂/∂x(x²y) + ∂/∂x(xy²) + ∂/∂x(sin(xy))
        = 2xy + y² + y cos(xy)

**Step 2: Find ∂f/∂y (treat x as constant)**
∂f/∂y = ∂/∂y(x²y) + ∂/∂y(xy²) + ∂/∂y(sin(xy))
        = x² + 2xy + x cos(xy)

**Answer:** ∂f/∂x = 2xy + y² + y cos(xy) and ∂f/∂y = x² + 2xy + x cos(xy)

**Multiple Integrals**

Multiple integrals extend the concept of integration to functions of several variables.

**Practice Problem 8: Double Integral**
Evaluate ∫∫[R] (x + y) dA where R is the rectangle [0,1] × [0,2]

**Solution:**
**Step 1: Set up the iterated integral**
∫∫[R] (x + y) dA = ∫₀¹ ∫₀² (x + y) dy dx

**Step 2: Integrate with respect to y first**
∫₀² (x + y) dy = [xy + y²/2]₀² = 2x + 2

**Step 3: Integrate with respect to x**
∫₀¹ (2x + 2) dx = [x² + 2x]₀¹ = 1 + 2 = 3

**Answer:** The double integral equals 3.

#### Real Analysis Foundations

**The Completeness Axiom**

The real numbers are complete, meaning every non-empty set of real numbers that is bounded above has a least upper bound (supremum).

**Practice Problem 9: Supremum and Infimum**
Find the supremum and infimum of the set S = {1/n : n ∈ ℕ}

**Solution:**
**Step 1: Analyze the set**
S = {1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, ...}

**Step 2: Find the supremum**
The largest element is 1, and no real number less than 1 is an upper bound.
Therefore, sup(S) = 1

**Step 3: Find the infimum**
The elements get arbitrarily close to 0 but never reach it.
Therefore, inf(S) = 0

**Answer:** sup(S) = 1 and inf(S) = 0

**Uniform Continuity**

A function f is uniformly continuous on a set A if for every ε > 0, there exists a δ > 0 such that |f(x) - f(y)| < ε whenever |x - y| < δ for all x, y ∈ A.

**Practice Problem 10: Uniform Continuity**
Show that f(x) = x² is not uniformly continuous on ℝ.

**Solution:**
**Step 1: Understand the definition**
We need to show that for some ε > 0, no single δ > 0 works for all x, y ∈ ℝ.

**Step 2: Choose ε = 1**
Let ε = 1. We'll show that for any δ > 0, we can find x, y with |x - y| < δ but |f(x) - f(y)| ≥ 1.

**Step 3: Find counterexample points**
Let x = n and y = n + δ/2, where n is a large positive integer.
Then |x - y| = δ/2 < δ

**Step 4: Calculate the difference**
|f(x) - f(y)| = |n² - (n + δ/2)²| = |n² - (n² + nδ + δ²/4)| = |nδ + δ²/4|

**Step 5: Show this can exceed ε**
For large enough n, nδ + δ²/4 > 1, violating uniform continuity.

**Answer:** f(x) = x² is not uniformly continuous on ℝ because the required δ depends on the location, not just on ε.

#### Applications and Historical Context

**Historical Development**

Calculus emerged from the need to solve problems in physics, particularly motion and gravitation. Newton developed his version to describe planetary motion, while Leibniz focused on the mathematical foundations and notation.

**Real-World Applications**

1. **Physics:** Motion, forces, energy, waves
2. **Engineering:** Optimization, control systems, fluid dynamics
3. **Economics:** Marginal analysis, optimization, growth models
4. **Biology:** Population dynamics, enzyme kinetics, neural networks
5. **Computer Science:** Algorithms, machine learning, optimization

**Common Misconceptions**

1. **"Derivatives are always about slopes"** - They also represent rates of change in non-geometric contexts
2. **"Integration is just finding area"** - It also represents accumulation, work, probability, and more
3. **"Limits are about getting close"** - They're about making values arbitrarily close, not just "close enough"
4. **"Calculus is only for continuous functions"** - Many discontinuous functions can be differentiated or integrated

**Advanced Extensions**

1. **Complex Analysis:** Extends calculus to complex numbers
2. **Differential Equations:** Studies relationships between functions and their derivatives
3. **Calculus of Variations:** Optimizes functionals (functions of functions)
4. **Non-Standard Analysis:** Uses infinitesimals for rigorous foundations
5. **Fractal Calculus:** Extends to non-integer dimensions

**Conclusion**

Calculus provides the mathematical language for describing and analyzing continuous change. Its concepts of limits, derivatives, and integrals form the foundation for much of modern mathematics and its applications. Mastery of these fundamental ideas opens the door to understanding advanced topics in analysis, differential equations, and mathematical modeling.

The key to success in calculus is developing intuition for the geometric and physical meanings of the concepts, while maintaining mathematical rigor in calculations and proofs. Practice with diverse problems helps build this intuition and computational skill.

### 10. LOGICAL PUZZLES & PROBLEMS

#### Introduction to Logical Problem Solving

Logical puzzles and problems are the heart of mathematical reasoning. They train us to think systematically, recognize patterns, construct rigorous arguments, and find creative solutions. This section explores various types of logical challenges that develop the core skills needed for advanced mathematical thinking and AGI reasoning.

The key to solving logical problems is not just finding the answer, but understanding the reasoning process. We'll focus on systematic approaches, proof techniques, and the development of mathematical intuition.

#### Logic Grid Puzzles

Logic grid puzzles, also known as logic puzzles or grid-based deduction problems, require organizing information in a systematic way to eliminate possibilities and find the correct arrangement.

**Example: The Colorful Houses Puzzle**

Five houses are painted different colors: red, blue, green, yellow, and white. Each house has a different owner, pet, and favorite drink. Use the clues to determine who lives where.

**Clues:**
1. The red house is next to the blue house
2. The person who owns the cat lives in the green house
3. The person who drinks coffee lives in the white house
4. The person who owns the dog lives next to the person who drinks tea
5. The person in the yellow house owns a bird

**Solution Method:**
1. Create a grid with houses as columns and attributes as rows
2. Use the clues to fill in known information
3. Apply logical deduction to eliminate impossible combinations
4. Use the process of elimination to complete the grid

**Practice Problem 1: The Restaurant Puzzle**

Three friends - Alice, Bob, and Carol - went to different restaurants for lunch. They ordered different dishes and paid different amounts. Use the clues to determine who went where, what they ordered, and how much they paid.

**Clues:**
1. Alice didn't go to the Italian restaurant
2. The person who ordered pizza paid $15
3. Bob paid more than Carol
4. The Chinese restaurant is more expensive than the Mexican restaurant
5. Carol didn't order tacos

**Solution:**
Let's solve this step by step:

1) **Organize the information:**
   - People: Alice, Bob, Carol
   - Restaurants: Italian, Chinese, Mexican
   - Dishes: Pizza, Tacos, Sushi
   - Prices: $12, $15, $18

2) **Apply the clues systematically:**
   - From clue 2: Pizza = $15
   - From clue 4: Chinese > Mexican (price-wise)
   - From clue 3: Bob > Carol (price-wise)
   - From clue 1: Alice ≠ Italian
   - From clue 5: Carol ≠ Tacos

3) **Deduce the solution:**
   - Since Bob paid more than Carol, and Chinese > Mexican, Bob must have gone to the Chinese restaurant
   - Carol must have gone to the Mexican restaurant (cheapest)
   - Alice must have gone to the Italian restaurant
   - Pizza costs $15, so the person who ordered pizza paid $15
   - Since Bob went to the most expensive restaurant, he paid $18
   - Carol paid the least, so she paid $12
   - Alice paid $15 (pizza price)
   - Carol didn't order tacos, so she ordered sushi
   - Alice ordered pizza
   - Bob ordered tacos

**Answer:**
- Alice: Italian restaurant, Pizza, $15
- Bob: Chinese restaurant, Tacos, $18  
- Carol: Mexican restaurant, Sushi, $12

#### Mathematical Brain Teasers

Mathematical brain teasers combine logical reasoning with mathematical concepts, often requiring creative thinking and pattern recognition.

**Example: The Missing Number Sequence**

Find the next number in the sequence: 2, 6, 12, 20, 30, ?

**Solution:**
Let's analyze the differences between consecutive terms:
- 6 - 2 = 4
- 12 - 6 = 6  
- 20 - 12 = 8
- 30 - 20 = 10

The differences form the sequence: 4, 6, 8, 10, ...
This is an arithmetic sequence with common difference 2.

So the next difference should be 12.
Therefore, the next term is 30 + 12 = 42.

**Practice Problem 2: The Pattern Recognition Challenge**

Find the next three numbers in this sequence: 1, 3, 7, 15, 31, ?

**Solution:**
Let's examine the pattern:

1) **Look at the differences:**
   - 3 - 1 = 2
   - 7 - 3 = 4
   - 15 - 7 = 8
   - 31 - 15 = 16

2) **The differences form a pattern:**
   - 2, 4, 8, 16, ...
   - Each difference is double the previous one

3) **Continue the pattern:**
   - Next difference: 16 × 2 = 32
   - Next term: 31 + 32 = 63
   - Following difference: 32 × 2 = 64
   - Next term: 63 + 64 = 127
   - Following difference: 64 × 2 = 128
   - Next term: 127 + 128 = 255

**Answer:** The next three numbers are 63, 127, 255.

**Pattern:** Each term is one less than a power of 2: 2¹-1=1, 2²-1=3, 2³-1=7, 2⁴-1=15, 2⁵-1=31, 2⁶-1=63, 2⁷-1=127, 2⁸-1=255.

#### Proof Construction Exercises

Proof construction is fundamental to mathematical reasoning. These exercises develop the ability to construct rigorous arguments and verify mathematical statements.

**Example: Proving the Sum of Consecutive Odd Numbers**

Prove that the sum of n consecutive odd numbers starting from 1 is n².

**Solution:**
1) **Express the sequence:**
   The first n consecutive odd numbers are: 1, 3, 5, 7, ..., (2n-1)

2) **Use the arithmetic sequence sum formula:**
   Sum = n/2 × (first term + last term)
   Sum = n/2 × (1 + (2n-1))
   Sum = n/2 × 2n
   Sum = n × n = n²

3) **Alternative proof using mathematical induction:**
   Base case: n = 1, sum = 1 = 1² ✓
   
   Inductive step: Assume true for n = k
   Sum of first k odd numbers = k²
   
   For n = k + 1:
   Sum = k² + (2k+1) = k² + 2k + 1 = (k+1)² ✓

**Practice Problem 3: Proving Divisibility**

Prove that for any positive integer n, n³ - n is divisible by 6.

**Solution:**
We'll prove this using factorization and properties of consecutive integers.

1) **Factor the expression:**
   n³ - n = n(n² - 1) = n(n-1)(n+1)

2) **Analyze the factors:**
   Among any three consecutive integers (n-1, n, n+1):
   - One must be divisible by 3
   - One must be divisible by 2 (even)

3) **Therefore:**
   - n(n-1)(n+1) is divisible by both 2 and 3
   - Since 2 and 3 are coprime, n(n-1)(n+1) is divisible by 6

4) **Verification:**
   For n = 1: 1³ - 1 = 0 = 6 × 0 ✓
   For n = 2: 2³ - 2 = 6 = 6 × 1 ✓
   For n = 3: 3³ - 3 = 24 = 6 × 4 ✓

**Answer:** n³ - n is divisible by 6 for all positive integers n.

#### Counterexample Finding

Finding counterexamples is crucial for disproving false statements and understanding the limits of mathematical claims.

**Example: Disproving a False Statement**

**Statement:** "All prime numbers are odd."

**Counterexample:** 2 is a prime number but it's even.

**Practice Problem 4: Finding Counterexamples**

Find a counterexample to disprove the statement: "For all real numbers x and y, if x < y, then x² < y²."

**Solution:**
1) **Understand the statement:**
   The claim is that if one number is less than another, then its square is also less.

2) **Look for cases where this fails:**
   Consider negative numbers: -3 < -2
   But (-3)² = 9 and (-2)² = 4
   Since 9 > 4, we have -3 < -2 but (-3)² > (-2)²

3) **Verify the counterexample:**
   -3 < -2 ✓ (true)
   (-3)² = 9 > 4 = (-2)² ✓ (contradicts the statement)

**Answer:** x = -3, y = -2 is a counterexample because -3 < -2 but (-3)² > (-2)².

**General rule:** The statement fails for negative numbers because squaring can reverse the order of negative numbers.

#### Pattern Recognition Challenges

Pattern recognition involves identifying underlying structures and relationships in seemingly complex problems.

**Example: The Fibonacci-like Sequence**

Find the next term in: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ?

**Solution:**
1) **Look for relationships between terms:**
   - 1 + 1 = 2
   - 1 + 2 = 3
   - 2 + 3 = 5
   - 3 + 5 = 8
   - 5 + 8 = 13

2) **Identify the pattern:**
   Each term is the sum of the two preceding terms

3) **Apply the pattern:**
   Next term = 8 + 13 = 21

**Practice Problem 5: The Hidden Pattern**

Find the next number in: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, ?

**Solution:**
1) **Look for a pattern:**
   - 1 = 1²
   - 4 = 2²
   - 9 = 3²
   - 16 = 4²
   - 25 = 5²
   - 36 = 6²

2) **Identify the rule:**
   Each term is the square of its position in the sequence

3) **Apply the rule:**
   Next term = 7² = 49

**Answer:** The next number is 49.

**Pattern:** This is the sequence of perfect squares: n² where n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, ...

#### Advanced Logical Challenges

**Practice Problem 6: The Truth-Teller and Liar Puzzle**

On an island, there are two types of people: truth-tellers who always tell the truth, and liars who always lie. You meet two people, A and B. A says: "B is a liar." B says: "A and I are different types." What type is each person?

**Solution:**
Let's solve this step by step using logical reasoning.

1) **Analyze A's statement:** "B is a liar"
   - If A is a truth-teller, then B is indeed a liar
   - If A is a liar, then B is actually a truth-teller

2) **Analyze B's statement:** "A and I are different types"
   - If B is a truth-teller, then A and B are different types
   - If B is a liar, then A and B are the same type

3) **Consider the possibilities:**
   
   **Case 1:** A is truth-teller, B is liar
   - A's statement "B is a liar" is true ✓
   - B's statement "A and I are different types" is a lie, so they are the same type ✗
   - This case leads to a contradiction

   **Case 2:** A is liar, B is truth-teller
   - A's statement "B is a liar" is a lie, so B is actually a truth-teller ✓
   - B's statement "A and I are different types" is true ✓
   - This case is consistent

**Answer:** A is a liar, B is a truth-teller.

**Practice Problem 7: The Color Hat Puzzle**

Three people are wearing hats, each hat is either red or blue. They can see each other's hats but not their own. They know that there are exactly two red hats and one blue hat. They are asked to determine their own hat color. After a while, one person correctly identifies their hat color. How did they figure it out?

**Solution:**
Let's call the people A, B, and C. Let's think through this step by step.

1) **What each person sees:**
   - A sees B and C's hats
   - B sees A and C's hats
   - C sees A and B's hats

2) **The key insight:**
   If someone sees two blue hats, they would immediately know their hat is red (since there must be exactly two red hats).

3) **The reasoning process:**
   - If A sees B and C both wearing blue hats, A would know their hat is red
   - If A sees one red and one blue hat, A cannot be certain
   - The fact that no one speaks immediately means no one sees two blue hats
   - Therefore, everyone sees at least one red hat

4) **The solution:**
   The person who figures it out must see one red and one blue hat. They reason:
   - "If my hat were blue, then the person with the red hat would see two blue hats and immediately know their hat is red"
   - "Since no one spoke immediately, my hat must be red"

**Answer:** The person who figured it out saw one red and one blue hat, and reasoned that if their own hat were blue, the person with the red hat would have known their hat color immediately.

#### Mathematical Induction Problems

**Practice Problem 8: Proving a Sum Formula**

Prove that 1² + 2² + 3² + ... + n² = n(n+1)(2n+1)/6 for all positive integers n.

**Solution:**
We'll use mathematical induction.

1) **Base case (n = 1):**
   Left side: 1² = 1
   Right side: 1(1+1)(2×1+1)/6 = 1×2×3/6 = 6/6 = 1
   ✓ Base case holds

2) **Inductive hypothesis:**
   Assume the formula holds for n = k:
   1² + 2² + ... + k² = k(k+1)(2k+1)/6

3) **Inductive step:**
   We need to show it holds for n = k + 1:
   1² + 2² + ... + k² + (k+1)² = (k+1)(k+2)(2k+3)/6

4) **Proof:**
   Starting with the left side:
   1² + 2² + ... + k² + (k+1)²
   = k(k+1)(2k+1)/6 + (k+1)² (by inductive hypothesis)
   = (k+1)[k(2k+1)/6 + (k+1)]
   = (k+1)[k(2k+1) + 6(k+1)]/6
   = (k+1)[2k² + k + 6k + 6]/6
   = (k+1)[2k² + 7k + 6]/6
   = (k+1)(k+2)(2k+3)/6

5) **Conclusion:**
   By the principle of mathematical induction, the formula holds for all positive integers n.

**Answer:** 1² + 2² + 3² + ... + n² = n(n+1)(2n+1)/6 for all positive integers n.

#### Combinatorial Reasoning

**Practice Problem 9: The Handshake Problem**

At a party, everyone shakes hands with everyone else exactly once. If there are n people at the party, how many handshakes occur?

**Solution:**
Let's solve this using combinatorial reasoning.

1) **First approach - Counting pairs:**
   - Each handshake involves exactly 2 people
   - We need to count how many ways we can choose 2 people from n people
   - This is the combination C(n,2) = n!/(2!(n-2)!)

2) **Second approach - Summing individual handshakes:**
   - Person 1 shakes hands with n-1 other people
   - Person 2 shakes hands with n-2 other people (already shook with person 1)
   - Person 3 shakes hands with n-3 other people
   - And so on...
   - Total = (n-1) + (n-2) + ... + 1 = n(n-1)/2

3) **Verification:**
   - For n = 2: C(2,2) = 1, and 2(2-1)/2 = 1 ✓
   - For n = 3: C(3,2) = 3, and 3(3-1)/2 = 3 ✓
   - For n = 4: C(4,2) = 6, and 4(4-1)/2 = 6 ✓

**Answer:** The number of handshakes is n(n-1)/2.

**Formula:** C(n,2) = n(n-1)/2

#### Advanced Logical Deduction

**Practice Problem 10: The Prisoner's Dilemma Variant**

Three prisoners, A, B, and C, are sentenced to death. The governor randomly selects one to pardon. The guard knows who will be pardoned but cannot tell the prisoners. Prisoner A asks the guard: "If B is to be executed, give me C's name. If C is to be executed, give me B's name. If I am to be pardoned, flip a coin and give me either B or C's name." The guard tells A that B is to be executed. What is the probability that A will be pardoned?

**Solution:**
This is a classic probability problem that requires careful analysis of conditional probability.

1) **Initial probabilities:**
   - P(A pardoned) = 1/3
   - P(B pardoned) = 1/3
   - P(C pardoned) = 1/3

2) **The guard's response:**
   The guard says "B is to be executed"

3) **Analyze what this means:**
   - If A was pardoned: Guard flips coin, could say B or C
   - If B was pardoned: Guard must say C (since B is pardoned)
   - If C was pardoned: Guard must say B

4) **Calculate conditional probability:**
   - P(Guard says B | A pardoned) = 1/2 (coin flip)
   - P(Guard says B | B pardoned) = 0 (impossible)
   - P(Guard says B | C pardoned) = 1 (certain)

5) **Apply Bayes' Theorem:**
   P(A pardoned | Guard says B) = 
   [P(Guard says B | A pardoned) × P(A pardoned)] / P(Guard says B)

   P(Guard says B) = P(Guard says B | A pardoned) × P(A pardoned) + 
                     P(Guard says B | B pardoned) × P(B pardoned) + 
                     P(Guard says B | C pardoned) × P(C pardoned)
                   = (1/2 × 1/3) + (0 × 1/3) + (1 × 1/3)
                   = 1/6 + 0 + 1/3 = 1/6 + 2/6 = 3/6 = 1/2

   Therefore:
   P(A pardoned | Guard says B) = (1/2 × 1/3) / (1/2) = (1/6) / (1/2) = 1/3

**Answer:** The probability that A will be pardoned is 1/3.

**Key insight:** The guard's response doesn't change the probability because the guard's strategy is designed to not reveal any additional information about who is pardoned.

### 11. APPLICATIONS & INTERDISCIPLINARY CONNECTIONS

#### Introduction to Interdisciplinary Applications

Mathematics and logic are not isolated disciplines but fundamental tools that permeate every field of human knowledge. This section explores how mathematical reasoning connects with computer science, physics, economics, philosophy, and artificial intelligence, demonstrating the universal power of logical thinking.

Understanding these connections is crucial for AGI development because it shows how abstract mathematical concepts translate into practical applications and how different domains can inform each other through shared logical frameworks.

#### Computer Science Applications

Computer science is built on mathematical foundations, from algorithms and data structures to cryptography and machine learning. Mathematical logic provides the theoretical framework for computation, while discrete mathematics enables efficient problem-solving.

**Example: Algorithm Complexity Analysis**

Consider the problem of finding the shortest path between two points in a weighted graph. This is a classic computer science problem with applications in navigation, network routing, and social network analysis.

**Practice Problem 1: Algorithm Efficiency Analysis**

A programmer has two algorithms to solve the same problem:
- Algorithm A: O(n²) time complexity, O(1) space complexity
- Algorithm B: O(n log n) time complexity, O(n) space complexity

For what values of n is Algorithm A more efficient than Algorithm B, considering both time and space?

**Solution:**
Let's analyze this step by step.

1) **Define the problem:**
   We need to find when Algorithm A is more efficient than Algorithm B.
   This means: Time_A + Space_A < Time_B + Space_B

2) **Express in terms of n:**
   - Time_A = n²
   - Space_A = 1
   - Time_B = n log n
   - Space_B = n

3) **Set up the inequality:**
   n² + 1 < n log n + n

4) **Simplify:**
   n² < n log n + n - 1
   n² < n(log n + 1) - 1

5) **Analyze for small values of n:**
   - n = 1: 1 < 1(0 + 1) - 1 = 0 ✗
   - n = 2: 4 < 2(1 + 1) - 1 = 3 ✗
   - n = 3: 9 < 3(1.58 + 1) - 1 = 6.74 ✗
   - n = 4: 16 < 4(2 + 1) - 1 = 11 ✗
   - n = 5: 25 < 5(2.32 + 1) - 1 = 15.6 ✗

6) **Find the crossover point:**
   We need to solve: n² = n(log n + 1) - 1
   This is approximately n ≈ 6.5

7) **Verify:**
   - n = 6: 36 < 6(2.58 + 1) - 1 = 20.48 ✗
   - n = 7: 49 < 7(2.81 + 1) - 1 = 25.67 ✗

**Answer:** Algorithm A is never more efficient than Algorithm B for n ≥ 1. The quadratic growth of Algorithm A's time complexity always outweighs the linear growth of Algorithm B's space complexity.

**Key insight:** Space complexity often has less impact on overall efficiency than time complexity, especially for large inputs.

#### Physics and Engineering Applications

Physics and engineering rely heavily on mathematical modeling and logical reasoning. Calculus, linear algebra, and differential equations provide the language for describing physical phenomena, while logical frameworks help design experiments and validate theories.

**Example: Harmonic Oscillator Analysis**

A mass-spring system follows the differential equation: m(d²x/dt²) + kx = 0, where m is mass, k is spring constant, and x is displacement.

**Practice Problem 2: Circuit Analysis**

In an RLC circuit, the current i(t) satisfies the differential equation:
L(d²i/dt²) + R(di/dt) + (1/C)i = 0

Given L = 1 H, R = 2 Ω, C = 1/4 F, and initial conditions i(0) = 1 A, di/dt(0) = 0 A/s, find i(t).

**Solution:**
Let's solve this step by step using the characteristic equation method.

1) **Write the differential equation:**
   d²i/dt² + 2(di/dt) + 4i = 0

2) **Find the characteristic equation:**
   r² + 2r + 4 = 0

3) **Solve the quadratic equation:**
   r = [-2 ± √(4 - 16)]/2 = [-2 ± √(-12)]/2 = [-2 ± 2i√3]/2 = -1 ± i√3

4) **General solution:**
   i(t) = e^(-t)[A cos(√3 t) + B sin(√3 t)]

5) **Apply initial conditions:**
   i(0) = 1: e^0[A cos(0) + B sin(0)] = A = 1
   
   di/dt = e^(-t)[-A cos(√3 t) - B sin(√3 t)] + e^(-t)[-A√3 sin(√3 t) + B√3 cos(√3 t)]
   di/dt(0) = 0: -A + B√3 = 0
   Since A = 1: -1 + B√3 = 0
   B = 1/√3

6) **Final solution:**
   i(t) = e^(-t)[cos(√3 t) + (1/√3)sin(√3 t)]

**Answer:** i(t) = e^(-t)[cos(√3 t) + (1/√3)sin(√3 t)]

**Physical interpretation:** This represents a damped oscillatory current that decays exponentially while oscillating at frequency √3 rad/s.

#### Economics and Game Theory

Economics and game theory use mathematical models to analyze strategic interactions, market behavior, and decision-making under uncertainty. Logical reasoning helps identify optimal strategies and predict outcomes.

**Example: Nash Equilibrium in Prisoner's Dilemma**

In the classic prisoner's dilemma, two players must choose between cooperation and defection, with payoffs that create a tension between individual and collective rationality.

**Practice Problem 3: Market Equilibrium Analysis**

Consider a market with demand function D(p) = 100 - 2p and supply function S(p) = 3p - 20. Find the equilibrium price and quantity, and calculate the consumer and producer surplus.

**Solution:**
Let's solve this step by step.

1) **Find equilibrium price:**
   Set D(p) = S(p)
   100 - 2p = 3p - 20
   100 + 20 = 3p + 2p
   120 = 5p
   p* = 24

2) **Find equilibrium quantity:**
   Q* = D(24) = 100 - 2(24) = 100 - 48 = 52
   Verify: Q* = S(24) = 3(24) - 20 = 72 - 20 = 52 ✓

3) **Calculate consumer surplus:**
   Consumer surplus = area under demand curve above price
   = ∫(0 to 52) [D^(-1)(Q) - 24] dQ
   
   D^(-1)(Q) = (100 - Q)/2 = 50 - Q/2
   
   Consumer surplus = ∫(0 to 52) [50 - Q/2 - 24] dQ
   = ∫(0 to 52) [26 - Q/2] dQ
   = [26Q - Q²/4] from 0 to 52
   = [26(52) - (52)²/4] - [0]
   = 1352 - 676 = 676

4) **Calculate producer surplus:**
   Producer surplus = area above supply curve below price
   = ∫(0 to 52) [24 - S^(-1)(Q)] dQ
   
   S^(-1)(Q) = (Q + 20)/3
   
   Producer surplus = ∫(0 to 52) [24 - (Q + 20)/3] dQ
   = ∫(0 to 52) [24 - Q/3 - 20/3] dQ
   = ∫(0 to 52) [52/3 - Q/3] dQ
   = [52Q/3 - Q²/6] from 0 to 52
   = [52(52)/3 - (52)²/6] - [0]
   = 2704/3 - 2704/6 = 2704/6 = 450.67

**Answer:**
- Equilibrium price: $24
- Equilibrium quantity: 52 units
- Consumer surplus: $676
- Producer surplus: $450.67

**Economic interpretation:** The market efficiently allocates resources, with consumers gaining more surplus than producers in this case.

#### Philosophy and Epistemology

Philosophy and epistemology examine the nature of knowledge, truth, and reasoning itself. Mathematical logic provides tools for analyzing arguments, identifying fallacies, and understanding the foundations of rational thought.

**Example: Logical Paradoxes and Their Resolution**

The liar paradox ("This statement is false") challenges our understanding of truth and self-reference, leading to important insights in logic and philosophy.

**Practice Problem 4: Logical Argument Analysis**

Analyze the following argument for validity:
1. All mathematicians are logical thinkers
2. Some logical thinkers are creative
3. Therefore, some mathematicians are creative

**Solution:**
Let's analyze this step by step using logical reasoning.

1) **Identify the argument structure:**
   - Premise 1: All M are L (All mathematicians are logical thinkers)
   - Premise 2: Some L are C (Some logical thinkers are creative)
   - Conclusion: Some M are C (Some mathematicians are creative)

2) **Use Venn diagrams to visualize:**
   - Draw three circles: M (mathematicians), L (logical thinkers), C (creative)
   - Premise 1: M is completely inside L
   - Premise 2: L and C overlap in some region

3) **Analyze the logical relationship:**
   - The conclusion claims that M and C overlap
   - But the premises only guarantee that M is inside L, and L overlaps with C
   - This doesn't guarantee that M overlaps with C

4) **Find a counterexample:**
   - Suppose all mathematicians are logical thinkers (Premise 1)
   - Suppose only non-mathematicians are creative logical thinkers (Premise 2)
   - Then no mathematicians are creative, contradicting the conclusion

5) **Identify the logical fallacy:**
   This is an example of the "illicit minor" fallacy in syllogistic logic.

**Answer:** The argument is invalid. It commits the logical fallacy of illicit minor, where the conclusion makes a claim about the relationship between the minor term (mathematicians) and the major term (creative) that is not supported by the premises.

**Key insight:** Validity in logic requires that the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises, not just that the conclusion might be true.

#### Artificial Intelligence and Reasoning

Artificial intelligence systems rely on mathematical logic for knowledge representation, reasoning, and decision-making. Understanding how to encode knowledge and perform logical inference is fundamental to building intelligent systems.

**Example: Knowledge Representation in AI**

AI systems use formal languages like first-order logic to represent knowledge about the world and perform automated reasoning.

**Practice Problem 5: AI Knowledge Base Design**

Design a knowledge base for a simple AI system that can answer questions about family relationships. The system should be able to handle queries like "Who is John's mother?" and "Are Alice and Bob siblings?"

**Solution:**
Let's design this step by step.

1) **Define the domain and predicates:**
   - Domain: People and family relationships
   - Predicates:
     * Parent(x, y): x is a parent of y
     * Sibling(x, y): x and y are siblings
     * Married(x, y): x and y are married

2) **Define the axioms (logical rules):**
   - ∀x∀y [Parent(x, y) → ¬Parent(y, x)] (No one is their own parent)
   - ∀x∀y∀z [Parent(x, y) ∧ Parent(x, z) ∧ y ≠ z → Sibling(y, z)] (Shared parent implies siblings)
   - ∀x∀y [Sibling(x, y) → Sibling(y, x)] (Siblinghood is symmetric)
   - ∀x∀y∀z [Parent(x, y) ∧ Parent(z, y) ∧ x ≠ z → Married(x, z) ∨ Married(z, x)] (Parents of same child are married)

3) **Add specific facts:**
   - Parent(Alice, John)
   - Parent(Bob, John)
   - Parent(Alice, Mary)
   - Parent(Bob, Mary)
   - Married(Alice, Bob)

4) **Answer queries:**
   
   **Query 1: "Who is John's mother?"**
   - Look for Parent(x, John) where x is female
   - From facts: Parent(Alice, John)
   - Answer: Alice is John's mother

   **Query 2: "Are Alice and Bob siblings?"**
   - Check if there exists z such that Parent(z, Alice) and Parent(z, Bob)
   - No such z exists in our facts
   - Answer: No, Alice and Bob are not siblings (they are married)

5) **Extend the system:**
   - Add gender predicates: Male(x), Female(x)
   - Add more relationship types: Grandparent, Cousin, etc.
   - Implement inference rules for derived relationships

**Answer:** The knowledge base includes:
- Predicates: Parent, Sibling, Married
- Axioms defining logical relationships
- Specific facts about family members
- Inference rules for answering queries

**Key insight:** AI knowledge representation requires both factual knowledge and logical rules that enable the system to derive new information and answer complex queries.

#### Cross-Disciplinary Problem Solving

Many real-world problems require knowledge from multiple disciplines. Mathematical logic provides a common framework for integrating different perspectives and finding unified solutions.

**Practice Problem 6: Multi-Domain Optimization**

A company wants to optimize its supply chain considering:
- Transportation costs (economics)
- Network reliability (computer science)
- Environmental impact (physics/engineering)
- Ethical considerations (philosophy)

Formulate this as a mathematical optimization problem.

**Solution:**
Let's formulate this step by step.

1) **Define decision variables:**
   - x_ij: amount of product shipped from location i to j
   - y_i: whether to build warehouse at location i (binary)
   - z_k: type of transportation mode k used

2) **Define objective function:**
   Minimize: Total Cost + Environmental Penalty + Reliability Penalty
   
   Total Cost = Σ_ij c_ij x_ij + Σ_i f_i y_i + Σ_k t_k z_k
   where c_ij = transportation cost, f_i = warehouse cost, t_k = mode cost

3) **Define constraints:**
   
   **Supply constraints:**
   Σ_j x_ij ≤ s_i for all i (supply limits)
   
   **Demand constraints:**
   Σ_i x_ij ≥ d_j for all j (demand requirements)
   
   **Capacity constraints:**
   Σ_ij x_ij ≤ Σ_i C_i y_i (warehouse capacity)
   
   **Environmental constraints:**
   Σ_ij e_ij x_ij ≤ E_max (emissions limit)
   
   **Reliability constraints:**
   Σ_k r_k z_k ≥ R_min (minimum reliability)

4) **Multi-objective formulation:**
   Minimize: w₁(Cost) + w₂(Environmental) + w₃(Reliability)
   where w₁, w₂, w₃ are weights reflecting company priorities

5) **Solution approach:**
   - Use linear programming for the basic problem
   - Apply multi-criteria decision analysis
   - Consider Pareto optimal solutions
   - Incorporate stakeholder preferences

**Answer:** The optimization problem is:
Minimize: w₁(Σ_ij c_ij x_ij + Σ_i f_i y_i + Σ_k t_k z_k) + w₂(Σ_ij e_ij x_ij) + w₃(1 - Σ_k r_k z_k)

Subject to supply, demand, capacity, environmental, and reliability constraints.

**Key insight:** Multi-domain problems require balancing competing objectives while respecting constraints from different fields.

#### Advanced Integration Problems

**Practice Problem 7: Quantum Computing and Cryptography**

In quantum computing, Shor's algorithm can factor large numbers efficiently, potentially breaking RSA encryption. Analyze the implications for cybersecurity and propose mathematical solutions.

**Solution:**
Let's analyze this step by step.

1) **Understand the threat:**
   - RSA security relies on difficulty of factoring n = pq
   - Classical algorithms: O(e^(√(ln n ln ln n))) time
   - Shor's algorithm: O((log n)³) time on quantum computer

2) **Mathematical analysis:**
   - For 2048-bit RSA: n ≈ 2²⁰⁴⁸
   - Classical: requires 2¹⁰²⁴ operations
   - Quantum: requires (2048)³ ≈ 8.6 × 10⁹ operations

3) **Post-quantum cryptography solutions:**
   
   **Lattice-based cryptography:**
   - Based on hardness of finding short vectors in lattices
   - Resistant to quantum attacks
   - Example: NTRU encryption

   **Code-based cryptography:**
   - Based on decoding random linear codes
   - McEliece cryptosystem
   - Large key sizes but quantum-resistant

   **Hash-based signatures:**
   - Based on cryptographic hash functions
   - One-time signatures with tree structures
   - Example: SPHINCS+

4) **Implementation considerations:**
   - Key sizes: Post-quantum schemes often have larger keys
   - Performance: Some schemes are slower than RSA
   - Standardization: NIST is evaluating post-quantum candidates

**Answer:** Quantum computing threatens RSA by reducing factoring complexity from exponential to polynomial time. Solutions include lattice-based, code-based, and hash-based cryptography, which are based on mathematical problems believed to be hard even for quantum computers.

**Key insight:** The security of cryptographic systems depends on the computational difficulty of underlying mathematical problems, which can change with new algorithms or computing paradigms.

   where:
   - L = logical reasoning component
   - P = probabilistic reasoning component
   - L = learning component
   - α, β, γ = weights for integration

5) **Implementation considerations:**
   - Scalability: Handle large knowledge bases
   - Efficiency: Real-time reasoning capabilities
   - Robustness: Handle inconsistent or incomplete information
   - Interpretability: Explainable reasoning processes

**Answer:** The AGI reasoning framework integrates logical, probabilistic, and learning components through weighted combination, with multi-agent coordination handled through game theory and communication protocols.

**Key insight:** AGI requires not just individual reasoning capabilities, but the ability to integrate multiple reasoning paradigms and coordinate with other intelligent agents.

#### Applications and Historical Context

### 12. ADVANCED TOPICS

#### Introduction to Advanced Mathematical Logic

Advanced topics in mathematical logic represent the cutting edge of our understanding of reasoning, computation, and the foundations of mathematics itself. These areas explore the deepest questions about what can be known, what can be computed, and how mathematical truth relates to human reasoning.

For AGI development, these advanced topics are crucial because they define the theoretical limits of what intelligent systems can achieve and provide frameworks for understanding the nature of intelligence itself.

#### Model Theory and Completeness

Model theory studies the relationship between formal languages and their interpretations in mathematical structures. It provides the foundation for understanding how mathematical statements relate to reality and how different interpretations can satisfy the same formal theory.

**Example: First-Order Logic Models**

Consider the language of groups with symbols {·, e, ⁻¹} and the group axioms. Different mathematical structures (like integers under addition, or symmetries of a square) can satisfy these axioms, providing different models of group theory.

**Practice Problem 1: Model Construction**

Construct a model for the following first-order theory:
- Language: {R} where R is a binary relation symbol
- Axioms:
  1. ∀x R(x, x) (reflexivity)
  2. ∀x∀y [R(x, y) → R(y, x)] (symmetry)
  3. ∀x∀y∀z [R(x, y) ∧ R(y, z) → R(x, z)] (transitivity)
  4. ∃x∃y [x ≠ y ∧ R(x, y)] (at least two related elements)

**Solution:**
Let's construct this step by step.

1) **Understand the axioms:**
   - Axiom 1: Every element is related to itself
   - Axiom 2: If x is related to y, then y is related to x
   - Axiom 3: If x is related to y and y is related to z, then x is related to z
   - Axiom 4: There are at least two distinct elements that are related

2) **Recognize the structure:**
   These axioms define an equivalence relation with at least two elements.

3) **Construct a simple model:**
   Let's use a set with two elements: A = {a, b}
   
   Define R as: R(a, a) = true, R(b, b) = true, R(a, b) = true, R(b, a) = true

4) **Verify all axioms:**
   - Axiom 1: R(a, a) and R(b, b) are both true ✓
   - Axiom 2: R(a, b) → R(b, a) and R(b, a) → R(a, b) both hold ✓
   - Axiom 3: All combinations satisfy transitivity ✓
   - Axiom 4: a ≠ b and R(a, b) is true ✓

5) **Alternative model:**
   We could also use the set {1, 2, 3} with R defined as equality (R(x, y) iff x = y)

**Answer:** One model is A = {a, b} with R(a, a) = R(b, b) = R(a, b) = R(b, a) = true. This satisfies all axioms and represents an equivalence relation where all elements are related to each other.

**Key insight:** Model theory shows how abstract axioms can be satisfied by concrete mathematical structures, providing meaning to formal languages.

#### Computability and Complexity

Computability theory studies what can and cannot be computed, while complexity theory analyzes the resources required for computation. These areas are fundamental to understanding the limits of algorithmic problem-solving.

**Example: The Halting Problem**

Alan Turing proved that there is no algorithm that can determine whether an arbitrary computer program will halt or run forever. This fundamental result shows that some problems are inherently unsolvable by computation.

**Practice Problem 2: Computability Analysis**

Consider the following decision problem: Given a program P and input x, determine if P(x) outputs "YES" for some input y.

Is this problem computable, partially computable, or uncomputable? Prove your answer.

**Solution:**
Let's analyze this step by step.

1) **Understand the problem:**
   We need to determine if there exists some input y such that P(x) outputs "YES"
   This is asking about the existence of a solution, not finding the solution itself

2) **Analyze computability:**
   - If P(x) outputs "YES" for some y, we can verify this by running P(x) on different inputs
   - If P(x) never outputs "YES", we might never know (infinite loop possibility)

3) **Consider the halting problem:**
   Suppose we had an algorithm A that solves our problem
   We could use A to solve the halting problem as follows:
   
   Given program P and input x, create program P':
   P'(y): if P halts on x, output "YES"; else, loop forever
   
   Now run A on P' and input x
   - If A says "YES" exists, then P halts on x
   - If A says "NO", then P loops forever on x

4) **Contradiction:**
   Since the halting problem is uncomputable, our original problem must also be uncomputable

5) **Formal proof:**
   - Assume our problem is computable
   - Show this leads to solving the halting problem
   - Since halting problem is uncomputable, our assumption is false
   - Therefore, our problem is uncomputable

**Answer:** This problem is uncomputable. We can prove this by reducing it to the halting problem, which is known to be uncomputable.

**Key insight:** Many seemingly simple problems about program behavior are actually uncomputable, showing fundamental limits to what can be automated.

#### Mathematical Logic History

The history of mathematical logic reveals how our understanding of reasoning has evolved from ancient syllogisms to modern formal systems. This historical perspective helps us understand current developments and anticipate future directions.

**Example: The Development of Set Theory**

Georg Cantor's work on infinite sets in the late 19th century revolutionized mathematics but also led to paradoxes that required new foundations and axiomatic approaches.

**Practice Problem 3: Historical Logic Development**

Trace the development of mathematical logic from the late 19th century to the mid-20th century, identifying how each major figure addressed the foundational crisis in mathematics.

**Solution:**
Let's trace this development chronologically.

1) **The foundational crisis (late 19th century):**
   - Cantor's set theory introduced actual infinities
   - Russell's paradox (1901): "The set of all sets that don't contain themselves"
   - This showed naive set theory was inconsistent

2) **Frege's response (1879-1903):**
   - Developed Begriffsschrift (concept script)
   - Attempted to reduce mathematics to logic
   - Russell's paradox undermined his system

3) **Russell and Whitehead's approach (1910-1913):**
   - Principia Mathematica: type theory to avoid paradoxes
   - Hierarchical structure of types
   - Very complex and not fully formalized

4) **Hilbert's program (1920s):**
   - Formalize all mathematics
   - Prove consistency using finitary methods
   - Goal: eliminate paradoxes through formalism

5) **Gödel's incompleteness theorems (1931):**
   - First theorem: Any consistent formal system containing arithmetic is incomplete
   - Second theorem: Such a system cannot prove its own consistency
   - This undermined Hilbert's program

6) **Turing's computability theory (1936):**
   - Defined computability using Turing machines
   - Showed some mathematical problems are uncomputable
   - Provided new perspective on mathematical foundations

7) **Church's lambda calculus (1930s):**
   - Alternative approach to computability
   - Foundation for functional programming
   - Church-Turing thesis: all computable functions are lambda-computable

**Answer:** The development progressed from Cantor's set theory through Frege's logicism, Russell's type theory, Hilbert's formalism, to Gödel's incompleteness results and Turing's computability theory. Each step addressed paradoxes and foundational issues, leading to modern understanding of logic and computation.

**Key insight:** Mathematical crises often lead to breakthroughs that reshape our understanding of fundamental concepts.

#### Contemporary Research Areas

Current research in mathematical logic explores new frontiers in proof theory, model theory, set theory, and their applications to computer science, artificial intelligence, and philosophy.

**Example: Homotopy Type Theory**

This emerging field unifies type theory with homotopy theory, providing new foundations for mathematics that are both constructive and powerful.

**Practice Problem 4: Modern Logic Research Analysis**

Analyze the implications of homotopy type theory (HoTT) for the foundations of mathematics and its potential applications to AGI reasoning systems.

**Solution:**
Let's analyze this step by step.

1) **What is HoTT:**
   - Unifies type theory with homotopy theory
   - Provides constructive foundations for mathematics
   - Treats mathematical objects as spaces with continuous deformations

2) **Key features:**
   - Univalence axiom: isomorphic types are equal
   - Higher inductive types: define types by their properties
   - Proof relevance: proofs carry computational content

3) **Implications for foundations:**
   - Constructive: all existence proofs provide algorithms
   - Univalent: mathematical structures are determined up to isomorphism
   - Computational: proofs can be executed as programs

4) **Applications to AGI reasoning:**
   
   **Knowledge representation:**
   - Types can represent concepts with rich structure
   - Isomorphisms capture meaningful equivalences
   - Higher-order structures model complex relationships

   **Proof construction:**
   - Constructive proofs provide algorithms
   - Type checking ensures logical consistency
   - Computational content enables verification

   **Learning and adaptation:**
   - Type systems can evolve with new knowledge
   - Univalence allows flexible concept matching
   - Higher inductive types support inductive learning

5) **Challenges and limitations:**
   - Complexity: HoTT is more complex than classical logic
   - Performance: Type checking can be computationally expensive
   - Familiarity: Requires new mathematical intuition

**Answer:** HoTT offers constructive, univalent foundations that could enhance AGI reasoning through rich type systems, computational proofs, and flexible knowledge representation. However, it requires significant computational resources and new mathematical frameworks.

**Key insight:** Modern logic research often focuses on making mathematics more computational and constructive, which aligns well with AGI requirements.

#### Open Problems and Conjectures

Open problems in mathematical logic represent the frontier of human understanding. These unsolved questions drive research and often reveal deep connections between seemingly unrelated areas.

**Example: The P vs NP Problem**

This fundamental question about computational complexity asks whether every problem whose solution can be verified quickly can also be solved quickly. Its resolution would have profound implications for cryptography, optimization, and artificial intelligence.

**Practice Problem 5: Open Problem Analysis**

The Continuum Hypothesis (CH) states that there is no cardinal number strictly between ℵ₀ (countable infinity) and 2^ℵ₀ (power set of countable infinity). Analyze the status of this problem and its implications.

**Solution:**
Let's analyze this step by step.

1) **Understanding the problem:**
   - ℵ₀ = cardinality of natural numbers
   - 2^ℵ₀ = cardinality of real numbers
   - CH asks: Is there a set with cardinality between these?

2) **Historical development:**
   - Cantor conjectured CH in 1878
   - Hilbert listed it as first problem in 1900
   - Gödel (1938): CH is consistent with ZFC
   - Cohen (1963): ¬CH is consistent with ZFC

3) **Current status:**
   - CH is independent of ZFC (standard set theory)
   - Neither CH nor ¬CH can be proved from ZFC
   - This means both are consistent with current foundations

4) **Implications:**
   
   **For mathematics:**
   - Shows limitations of current axiomatic systems
   - Suggests need for new axioms or foundations
   - Demonstrates that some questions are undecidable

   **For set theory:**
   - Different models of ZFC can have different answers to CH
   - This affects the "truth" of mathematical statements
   - Raises questions about mathematical realism

   **For AGI:**
   - Shows that some mathematical questions are undecidable
   - Suggests AGI might need to work with multiple consistent theories
   - Demonstrates importance of axiomatic choice

5) **Research directions:**
   - Large cardinal axioms
   - Forcing axioms
   - Inner model theory
   - Multiverse perspectives

**Answer:** The Continuum Hypothesis is independent of ZFC, meaning it cannot be resolved within current mathematical foundations. This shows fundamental limitations of axiomatic systems and suggests that AGI systems may need to work with multiple consistent mathematical universes.

**Key insight:** Some mathematical questions are fundamentally undecidable, requiring new foundations or acceptance of multiple valid mathematical worlds.

#### Advanced Proof Techniques

Modern mathematical logic employs sophisticated proof techniques that go beyond traditional methods, including forcing, inner models, and advanced set-theoretic constructions.

**Practice Problem 6: Advanced Proof Construction**

Prove that there exists a model of ZFC in which the Continuum Hypothesis is false, using the concept of forcing.

**Solution:**
Let's construct this proof step by step.

1) **Understanding forcing:**
   - Forcing is a technique for constructing new models of set theory
   - It adds new sets to existing models
   - The new model satisfies ZFC but may have different properties

2) **Setup:**
   - Start with a countable transitive model M of ZFC
   - We want to add new subsets of ω (natural numbers)
   - This will increase the power set cardinality

3) **Define the forcing notion:**
   - P = {p: p is a finite partial function from ω × ω to {0,1}}
   - p ≤ q if p extends q (q ⊆ p)
   - This represents partial information about new subsets

4) **Generic filter construction:**
   - A generic filter G meets every dense set in M
   - G determines a complete function f: ω × ω → {0,1}
   - Each row of f represents a new subset of ω

5) **Adding new subsets:**
   - For each α < ω₂ in M, define A_α = {n: f(α, n) = 1}
   - These are new subsets not in M
   - They increase the power set cardinality

6) **Verifying the model:**
   - M[G] = M ∪ {A_α: α < ω₂}
   - M[G] satisfies ZFC (forcing theorem)
   - In M[G], 2^ℵ₀ ≥ ℵ₂, so CH is false

7) **Cardinality calculation:**
   - In M[G], we have at least ℵ₂ many subsets of ω
   - Since ℵ₀ < ℵ₂ < 2^ℵ₀, CH fails

**Answer:** By using forcing to add ℵ₂ many new subsets of ω to a countable model of ZFC, we create a model where the Continuum Hypothesis is false, demonstrating its independence from ZFC.

**Key insight:** Forcing allows us to construct models with specific properties, showing that certain statements are independent of given axioms.

#### Complexity Theory and Logic

The relationship between computational complexity and logical complexity reveals deep connections between what can be computed and what can be proven.

**Practice Problem 7: Complexity-Logic Connection**

Prove that if P = NP, then there exists a polynomial-time algorithm for finding proofs of mathematical statements.

**Solution:**
Let's prove this step by step.

1) **Understanding the problem:**
   - P = NP means every NP problem can be solved in polynomial time
   - We need to show this implies efficient proof finding
   - This connects computational complexity to logical proof systems

2) **Formalizing proof finding:**
   - Given a mathematical statement φ, find a proof π such that π ⊢ φ
   - This is an NP problem: given π, we can verify π ⊢ φ in polynomial time
   - Therefore, proof finding is in NP

3) **Using P = NP:**
   - If P = NP, then proof finding can be solved in polynomial time
   - This means we can find proofs efficiently
   - The algorithm would be polynomial in the length of φ

4) **Implications:**
   
   **For mathematics:**
   - Automated theorem proving becomes efficient
   - Mathematical research could be automated
   - Proof verification becomes trivial

   **For AGI:**
   - Logical reasoning becomes computationally tractable
   - Knowledge discovery becomes efficient
   - Mathematical creativity could be automated

5) **Limitations:**
   - The proof might be extremely long
   - Finding the shortest proof is still hard
   - Human understanding might not follow

**Answer:** If P = NP, then proof finding becomes polynomial-time solvable, enabling efficient automated theorem proving and potentially revolutionizing mathematical research and AGI reasoning capabilities.

**Key insight:** Computational complexity directly affects what can be efficiently proven, showing deep connections between computation and logic.

#### Future Directions in Mathematical Logic

6) **Ethical reasoning:**
   
   **Deontic logic:**
   - Obligations and permissions
   - Rights and duties
   - Ethical constraint satisfaction

   **Value alignment:**
   - Human value modeling
   - Preference learning
   - Ethical decision making

7) **Mathematical formulation:**
   
   **Unified reasoning function:**
   R(s, a, o) = Σᵢ wᵢ Lᵢ(s, a, o)
   where Lᵢ are different logical components and wᵢ are adaptive weights

**Answer:** The AGI logic framework integrates multi-modal logic, probabilistic reasoning, learning mechanisms, multi-agent coordination, temporal/spatial reasoning, and ethical reasoning through a unified mathematical structure that adapts and learns over time.

**Key insight:** AGI requires not just classical logic, but a rich, adaptive framework that handles uncertainty, learning, coordination, and ethical considerations.

For AGI development, understanding these advanced topics is crucial because they define the theoretical limits of intelligent systems and provide frameworks for building more sophisticated reasoning capabilities. The future of mathematical logic lies in deeper integration with computation, learning, and multi-agent systems, creating new possibilities for artificial intelligence and human understanding.

The key insight is that advanced logic is not just about abstract mathematical structures, but about creating systems that can reason, learn, and adapt in complex, uncertain environments. This vision of logic as a dynamic, computational discipline is essential for building AGI systems that can truly understand and interact with the world.

As we continue to explore these frontiers, we discover that the boundaries between logic, computation, and intelligence are increasingly blurred, suggesting that the future of mathematical logic may be inseparable from the future of artificial intelligence itself.
